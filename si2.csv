Turkish Airlines,10,Zeshan Shah,6th May 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Flew on Turkish Airlines IAD-IST-KHI and return KHI-IST-IAD. Turkish Airlines has consistently maintained its quality since I first flew with them in 2007. The flights leave on time, the catering is excellent, the inflight entertainment is extensive and the interface easy to use, and the cabin crew is excellent. Interesting though the A330 on the KHI-IST route and return seemed to have more leg room and was newer than the A330 on the IAD-IST route which was showing its age. The A330 on the IAD-IST route had a slow responding interface for the inflight entertainment and a broken table on the return flight. But Turkish Airlines will be replacing the A330 on its flight to IAD with the 787 sometime in the summer. Turkish food was served on the return leg which I personally like, and I saw the cabin staff helping elderly passengers walk to the lavatory which was nice. Overall another wonderful experience with Turkish Airlines.",A330,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington Dulles to Karachi,Apr-19,4,5,5,5,5,5,yes

When I arrived in Istanbul at 10pm we are informed that TK44 to Cape Town (departure at 1.55am) is delayed 4,5 hours. No reason for this Delay was announced. I received a voucher for Burger King, Sbarro Pizza or Popeys.

Turkish Airlines,6,Sami Osman,29th April 2019,"Not Verified | Abu Dhabi to Luxembourg via Istanbul. From AUH-IST, as the flight was at 1:30am, the flight was I comfortable due to the small size of the aircraft. The seats were cramped although the leg room was okay-ish. Service started mid way through and the food was okay but nothing great. Staff was mostly friendly. IST-LUX staff was friendlier, aircraft was bit better, the food was of the same standard though. I think it was a decent experience overall but I would prefer a more spacious air craft even if the flight is 4.5 hours from AUH.",A320 / Boeing 737,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Abu Dhabi to Luxembourg via Istanbul,Apr-19,2,3,3,3,3,3,yes
Turkish Airlines,1,Norka Idalia Orlando,28th April 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | The experience with Turkish Airlines has been devastating one. First paid $200 Euros per luggage, totaling $400 Euros for 2 luggage that end up lost between Turkish Airlines and JetBlue. My itinerary was from Venice to Istanbul to Boston and from there with Jetblue to San Juan, Puerto Rico. Once I made it to Boston I looked for my luggage and it never made it to BOS. I immediately try to make a reclamation to Turkish Airlines at BOS and was told that I had to wait until my final destination. Once I made it to my final destination I made my claim. Turkish Airlines will not cooperate with Jetblue and even if JB was really trying to help is not much they could do because TATurkish Airlines did not care for my luggage. It never made to Boston. Turkish Airlines have been unhelpful. In my case, even presenting evidence to both airlines, neither is able to find my lost claim luggage. It seems the claim is a form which after being submitted it get to be submitted evidence, dead word, as they do not even comply with the search of the lost not delivered luggage in hands of Turkish Airlines.",A320 / A330,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Venice to Boston via Istanbul,Feb-19,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Turkish Airlines,2,Trevor Khurana,24th April 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Houston to Kiev via Istanbul. Fares seem competitive, but there is a catch in terms of layover time. Mine from Houston to Kiev Via Istanbul had a return leg layover of 14 hours and though TK website says that a layover of over a certain hours gets a complimentary hotel stay. But there is a fine print somewhere which they always get a disqualified citing some wired Ã¢â‚¬Å“rulesÃ¢â‚¬Â that I, even as a frequent traveler cannot comprehend. Another notable difference in Turkey is that there are endless and multiple security checks, and one wonders if one is going through a war zone . Lines at security checks and passport control ( yes, if you need to stay at a hotel for a long layover, one needs to get an e-VISA just to get out, check into a hotel and get back to airport to catch the connecting flight). Ended up paying way more than if I had chosen other airlines like LH or SAS, which I will keep in mind next time",Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Kiev via Istanbul,Mar-19,1,3,2,2,1,1,no
Turkish Airlines,5,Gyan Fernando,21st April 2019,Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Nakhchivan to Istanbul. The flight set off a little bit late and boarding was disorderly with too many passengers carrying oversized baggage on board. The aircraft appeared to be old with drop-down screens for entertainment which were virtually useless. Cabin service was not very good and staff appeared not to care.,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Nakhchivan to Istanbul,Apr-19,2,2,3,1,2,3,yes
Turkish Airlines,7,Gyan Fernando,21st April 2019,Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | London Heathrow to Istanbul. The flight from LHR took off on time. Boarding was hassle free. Seating was 3x3x3.

Turkish Airlines,8,S Tekin,20th April 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Izmir to Istanbul. It was my first Boeing 777 experience. They gave a free hot sandwich with cheese and vegetables and a drink. Hot and cold options were rich. Cold ones weren't very cold but you can add some ice to them. Plane was really big and crowded yet there were no problem with fresh air and air conditioning. Well, maybe one. One of the cabins leaked some water to a passenger. They suddenly suggested he change his seat, he refused. Flight on time, good cabin crew. And this time, it was extremely cheap.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Izmir to Istanbul,Apr-19,4,5,4,4,5,5,yes
Turkish Airlines,4,John Choi,18th April 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Baku to Amsterdam via Istanbul. They still operate like a third world airline. Check in counter staff at the new airport was ignorant (when she finished my check in, she just left the boarding pass and my passport on the counter instead of handing them to me). I changed my seat the previous night when doing the online check in. When boarding the agent said I had the wrong seat and put me back at my old seat. I asked why, and she said they changed plane.

Turkish Airlines,2,Eric Bjorneby,17th April 2019,"Not Verified | New York JFK to Tel Aviv via Istanbul. Do not fly Turkish Airlines! We had round trip scheduled March-April 2019. Just before leaving on our trip they cancelled the second leg of our return flight and placed us on another flight which involved a 14 hour layover in Istanbul airport. Then, upon arrival in Istanbul on our way out to Tel Aviv they cancelled the second leg of this part of the trip as we stood at the gate waiting for departure and put us on another flight several hours later because the later flight was not full. Imagine 300 People at an airline gate waiting as staff filled out new boarding passes for everyone by hand!. We cancelled our return arrangements (without refund) and flew another airline home at the end of our vacation.

Turkish Airlines,1,Nirjal Shrestha,16th April 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Kathmandu to Berlin via Istanbul. Their service is worst because they usually overbook the flight and it was like first come first serve basis and airport staff donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even listen the customer request. They treat people like they are doing favor to them. Flight often delayed by 2- 4 hours and they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care about your connecting flight. In my return flight after issuing boarding pass, my seat plan was changed without any notice and in flight entertainment system is damaged and it was 9 hours long flight. I have requested several times but they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t give attention to the passengers request.",,Business,Economy Class,Kathmandu to Berlin via Istanbul,Apr-19,1,1,1,1,1,1,no

Turkish Airlines,1,L Kaladri,11th April 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Amman via Istanbul. Beside being one of the filthiest airport bathrooms and cheap of course for not making it easy to use the Wi-Fi, they make us wait 5 more hours in the transit just because they can fill up the plane by merging another plane for people who are going to Amman without giving us any notice! And after waiting hours now to check-in online, now they saying check-in at the counter.

Turkish Airlines,1,Pranay Rao,6th April 2019,"Not Verified | Mumbai to Istanbul. One of the worst experiences of our life has been this trip on Turkish Airlines. After booking a confirmed flight on 6th April we were offered one in which the connecting flight leaves 2 days earlier than we land. Thankfully we didn't select this by mistake. Then we were given a new itinerary which needed us staying overnight at Istanbul. We were then given a hotel room outside the airport which needed us to spend 220 USD on an express visa to enter Turkey plus an additional 100 USD on travel. The airline doesn't give you rooms in the airport, which turns out to be more expensive for the passenger as there is no proper public transport to our hotel room and Turkish won't pay for it. To make matters worse today the check in doesn't work and they've told us we need to reach early to the airport if we need good seats. Avoid this airline for its terrible customer service.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Istanbul,Apr-19,1,1,1,1,1,1,no

Turkish Airlines,2,S Raesen,2nd April 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Bangkok via Istanbul. I wont book again after the conditions I flew in. Food: tasty. Over the average for an airline. In-flight entertainment: large variety of movies. Cabin crew: negligent and sloppy, to a frustrating level. So many episodes where they disregarded very simple requests from passengers or (worse) caused problems due to their disorganization. Gate crew: at the check-in I chose a spot that would allow me to easily access the bathroom, that I need for medical reasons. At the gate the seat got striked through and I have been re-assigned, no explanations provided. When I asked for the seat to be changed to an aisle seat, I have been told by the cabin crew to temporarily sit on the assigned seat. After take-off, my request got ignored for the whole flight, regardless many seats were empty. Seats extremely unconfortable and impossible to sleep in (very old plane for a 10h flight). Mine was even broken so I could not sleep at all. Food service: chaotic to the point that some people started to serve themselves due to the fact that their requests were disregarded or forgotten. Overall a very bad experience that leaves me confused at how this company won any awards. At first I also gave it the benefit of the doubt that's why I waited to write the review but the return flight confirmed all the negligent behaviors I saw on the departure flight. Other airlines offer very similar prices and the cons don't make up for the flight conditions you will experience.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Bangkok via Istanbul,Mar-19,1,1,5,5,1,1,no
Turkish Airlines,1,Tomas Gubas,2nd April 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Venice to Ankara via Istanbul. Instead of taking off on time the fight was originally delayed (on the information table was written 10 minutes). I was satisfied with the information (it is possible to be delayed). The next information which followed invited us to go to the gate. More than 75% of passengers created the line in front of the desk and we were waiting for opening the gate. It was the first mistake, after 45 minutes the staff changed the departure time on the information desk for 10.50 a.m. Nobody knew that the game was started. The plane was delayed by more than 60 minutes. It is usually that the staff will give you any additional information about the connection flights. Unfortunately, it is not the case of Turkish Airlines . After the arrival, I run from the plane through the tunnel in the terminal and hoped to catch the flight to Ankara. The guy who was wearing the TA uniform and who was waiting at the end of the tunnel showed me the direction where I should have found the gate of for my flight. Of course, it was the wrong direction and I had to run back. After that, I had to go through the x-ray frame and I have lost another 10 minutes although I didn't leave the secured area. When I came into the main hall I sew that the gate is closed. Until this moment nobody has apologized for the inconvenience and to this day too. This horror trip was still not at the end. I tried to find the TA office and I found only the TA desk where was it possible to buy new tickets. When I started to explain my situation and the guy behind the desk recognised that I am not a new potential customer his face expression changed rapidly and his bored voice said to me that he is not responsible for information. The problem was closed for him. After a few minutes, I found the desk with the logo TA in the check-in sections. I run there to solve the problem and I tried to inform the first staff about my situation. His answer was: ""Wait a minute"".. I didn't want to wait and I said to him, that his company is responsible for the situation and I expect more empathy and full service for customers. No answer, only disgusted reaction visible in his mimic and he showed me with the finger another TA worker sitting next to him. This person let explain to him my situation again and he printed a new boarding pass for the flight at 6.00 p.m. I checked the departure on the screen and by my next flight was additional information that it is delayed 40 minutes before the departure. I asked the guy again whether it is mean serious and my second question was why it is not possible to get the ticket for the flight at 5.00 p.m.? The answer was given with the highest arrogance in his voice.""The flight is full!"". And it is still not the end of the troubles, instead of being delayed 40 minutes the ""great"" TA let me wait one hour longer in comparison with original departure schedule. The service was the mess and the behaviour of the employees was everything but not professional.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Venice to Ankara via Istanbul,Mar-19,3,1,3,,1,1,no

The drinks trolley service came by and the same FA who told me Ã¢â‚¬ËœoffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ remembered what drinks I had asked and served me.

Turkish Airlines,1,Jaylesh Gandhi,28th March 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Flew TK 5 / 22 MAR, Istanbul - Chicago in business class. Had requested AVML (Asian vegetarian Meal). TK had forgotten my special AVML meal. On board they served boiled eggplant, tomato sauce and disgusting rice as THE main course. I refused to eat and returned my plate. No alternative food offered. I spoke to the cabin chief who expressed she was sorry and agreed that the meal served was not even close to AVML. Spoke to the chef on board who had no clue what AVML looks like. Starved for 12 hour flight. Cabin chief and the chef promised they would report this incident but it seems it did not go anywhere. I am an Elite Plus member of Turkish Airlines and it seems they do not care about their premium cabin passengers. Surprisingly cabin chief is TK's employee and the chef are employed by DO & CO catering company who provided meals for TK's passengers. Complained about the incident and response I got was we regret and no compensations given.

Turkish Airlines,1,Andrei Muravev,20th March 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | I bought and paid tickets 3 months before departure. I had pre-selected certain seats convenient to us. I am a self-moving disabled person. I have no leg, I move on a prosthesis. The choice of a comfortable place is important for my sick leg. When I flying from Hurghada Ã¢â‚¬â€œ at the reception manager not given our pre-selected seats. He give to me uncomfortable seats in the tail of the aircraft, although I chose a seats for 4 months before departure. Turkish Airlines does not have Internet check-in when passengers departing from Hurghada. At the check-in Desk, the Manager issues boarding passes at random, not paying attention to the pre-selected seats in our tickets. 2. Indifference flight attendants In the plane, I ask for 2 flight attendants and explained the essence of the problem, said about my disability, showed my ticket. The flight attendants answered me: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The plane is full. I can't help you, sorryÃ¢â‚¬Â The flight attendants were absolutely indifferent to my problems, they did not want to help me. 3. Stuff indifference at Ataturk Airport. Upon arrival in Istanbul, I had a connection time at the airport: 3: 20 - with our next flight to Vnukovo, Moscow. I was very tired, I had a pain in my leg, and I turned to the Info desk to ask the managers to let me rest for a short time in the lounges of Turkish Airlines. I said that I was disabled, I asked for help. In response, I received complete indifference, unwillingness to help me. The manager refused me any help, despite my repeated requests for help. I have not seen anywhere such a bad attitude, indifference to the disabled person in my air travels! 3. Problem with pre-ordered special meals When I buying tickets, my wife and I ordered Bland meal (BLML) and Diabetic meal (DBML) We always order in flights these types of food for our medical reasons. In all the airlines that we flew this food is much better than the standard meal. But in the case of Turkish Airlines, our special meal was simply inedible. This special meal given to us looked much worse than the standard nutrition. We just could not eat anything and flew hungry all our flights Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in two ways! I remember that in my meal there was a lot of fiber, which I cannot eat. This is incompatible with the concept of the Bland meal (BLML) diet.",Boeing 737-800,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Hurghada to Moscow via Istanbul,Apr-18,2,1,1,3,2,2,no
Turkish Airlines,6,S Railey,13th March 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Manila to Istanbul. If you ever flew with Emirates or Qatar Airways, you will miss their service if you fly Turkish Airlines.

Turkish Airlines,1,Masudur Rahman,13th March 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Dhaka to Copenhagen via Istanbul. This trip was full of disappointments. Already the airport lounge, Dhaka, demanded money for a glass of wine, unheard. I am a frequent flyer, I have never experienced business class lounge charging a business class passenger, for a glass of wine. Next, on board, no welcome drinks. I asked for a newspaper and a drink, the choice was a glass of water or a lemonade. After take-off, no beverage and snacks, just the meal, which was disgusting. My choice was beef, which was cold, dry, served with some bean and carrots, also cold. I asked for a glass of red wine, but waiting and waiting, I tried to draw the attention of a crew, who was talking with another passenger in the front row. Then I had to get up went where he was enjoying a conversation with the passenger. I made my request- I got served a glass of wine-. I expressed my gratitude- and the crew explained the delay- he had to take care of a CIP. The meal was eatabel, so asked for a cup of coffee and a glass of cognac. Surprise- the crew said there was no cognac. I showed the menu, which showed cognac was available. Well, had almost 6hours layover at Istanbul airport lounge, which was OK. About 90 minutes prior to board, we were asked to go the the gate. After completion of checking tickets and passports, we were waiting to board- almost 45 minutes had to wait and then bus to the plain. The flight was on way to Copenhagen. There were a grpoup of Danish passengers,. A elderly gentleman asked for lass of cognac, the crew was about to serve a generous glass of cognac. Another female crew rushed and snatched the glass, poured half of the content to another glass and then served the guest.

No assistance was given to passengers, everybody had to wander around the immense airport, address the numerous TK people behind desks each of whom seemed to take care of anything but customer service and only care to dispatch people somewhere else. Finally we got to the right desk and were given the TK flight leaving at 16.15, 10 hours waiting time. We were assured this was the first possibility open.

Turkish Airlines,4,Sebastian Pietzsch,12th March 2019,"Not Verified | Boarding totally chaotic and far too long. Nice meal, creepy safety video which distracted the people more than giving them advice. Crew notifications (strong turkish accent, sound quality) hardly understandable, even for native speakers. Economy legroom and seat width did not at all suit the flight duration on the first flight from Phuket to Istanbul (11 hours), more equal to short-distance low costers. (disclaimer: I had a seat at an emergency exit, luckily). WiFi did not work for me and others at all, for some more expensive devices it did, but very slowly (asked my neighbours and staff for help, but no way to get it working).

Turkish Airlines,8,Bobby Giannakopoulos,8th March 2019,Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | This was my first time using Turkish Airlines and I was satisfied. Check in at Lyon airport was fine. The flight was full but I managed to find space for my carry on bags. The flight left a bit late. The cabin on board was in good condition and seem to be new. The crew and the service was good. The inflight entertaiment is excellent with a big screen for each sea and a great selection of different type of movies. The meal was tasty and there was a good selection of any type of drinks. The flight went fine but it took more time to land in Ataturk airport because of weather in Istanbul.

Turkish Airlines,4,E Janginen,5th March 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Dublin to Manila via Istanbul. This flight was both a disaster and a nightmare. This incident happened during Istanbul-Manila leg of my flight. Im not sure what happened, but I your ground crew was disorderly and very unwelcoming. The boarding was horrible, flying business is not worth it especially I am queueing with the rest of the passengers. The on board experience was the tipping point. Since last year, I never had problem with my Vegan meal onboard as I make sure to preselect them online. But this flight was a disaster. Not only I made only preselection, I wrote to the menu that I am vegan, and the chef was aware i dont eat cheese as he asked me before flight. When I was served with appetizers, I was curious as they gave me a butter on a small dish. At first, I though it could be vegan as I was given butter previously, but that was on a pack, not this time. I called the head steward and explain my conundrum. The chef came and explained and apologized. They insisted i ordered vegetarian as shown on their records, but I showed my confirmation email that I did preselect Vegan meal. Somewhere something went wrong. I settled for orange juice, and went to sleep. Before landing, the chef gave me a minimal but unbusiness like food. I still appreciate his effort to come up with vegan food.",Boeing 777 300ER,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Dublin to Manila via Istanbul,Feb-19,3,3,1,3,1,2,no
Turkish Airlines,1,Julie Fry,24th February 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Never again will I use Turkish Airlines. We booked the ticket to Cape Town from Malaga (via Istanbul) 6 months in advance and chose Turkish due to the more direct route than having to travel to UK/Northern Europe or Middle East. We paid for extra legroom seats on all flights. One hour before leaving for the airport on our outbound date I received a phone call from the Turkish Airlines ticket desk at Malaga Airport to advise that the Istanbul-Malaga (second leg) of our return journey flight had been cancelled. They told us to go to the ticket desk when we arrived and before we checked in to be given options. The options were an 8 hour wait in Istanbul airport for the next flight (no thank you after an 11 hour flight) or the same flights a day later. We opted for the second option of flying on our original flight choices day later. The lady on the desk suggested that we claim afterwards for the extra hotel night and the extra day car hire. She also said that she could not book us the seats we had already paid for and that we should try to ticket desk in cape Town to do this for us. We checked in, we started to board, they got us all on to the air bridge where we stayed for about an hour before being moved back into the terminal. Then we boarded. The flight departed 90 minutes late with no explanation. The staff said that they did not know what the problem was. We arrived in Istanbul with a short connection due to the delay and after being bussed from the plane to the terminal we ran like crazy to get on the flight. We made it but our luggage remained in Istanbul. One case arrived a day later & the second case 2 days later. We collected the first case ourselves (as we thought they were both there) and went to the ticket desk to arrange the seats for the return journey. We had to leave all of our details with them as they were busy and unable to attend to it at the time. I e:mailed the ticket desk and customer services a number of times and each time the mails were returned with a message saying that the inboxes were full and could not accept any further mails. I also made a few phone calls but never managed to get an answer. After about a week I received a call from the ticket desk with an offer of slightly different but acceptable seats. When I told her about the issues I had ben having regarding contacting them she told me that the sales desk were very short staffed and that there actually isnt a customer service unit at all in Cape Town. During this time we were travelling with friends around the Cape and at times were without internet so communications were difficult. I also began the process of trying to claim for the emergency clothing items that we had to buy. I am still trying to complete the electronic form which keeps saying that I am giving wrong information (it doesnt specify what it doesnt like) and I am simply completing each box in order as it request me to do - along with the uploading of the files they request. I have tried to complete this form numerous times and in the beginning with help from the baggage handling company who confirmed that I was completing the form correctly. To this day I am still in communication with Turkish Airlines requesting them to reimburse me. They have refused to reimburse us with the cost of the hotel & car rental and are fobbing me off regarding the clothing cost. I know that I am legally entitled to this so I will continue to press.",Boeing 737-800 / A330-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Malaga to Cape Town via Istanbul,Jan-19,2,2,1,2,1,1,no
Turkish Airlines,4,T Barlin,20th February 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Montreal to Berlin via Istanbul. I was mostly disappointed with the services. I flew from Montreal to Istanbul and from the beginning I felt the experience to be flawed. There were some 28 business class seats and I had chosen a seat with direct aisle access. The seat is quite comfortable and large was what I noticed at first. The cabin crew was awful. They congregated at the forward cabin near the bar and watched us settle in. As we were in the middle of winter, passengers all had heavy winter coats. I was seated in row two and could overhear some passengers asking the crew if they could take their coats. I was a bit taken aback by the crews response: ""No, later, later"". Needless to say, I was not going to go out of my way to ask them to take my coat and instead opted to leave it at my seat. The crew members did not offer to take my coat nor my neighbour's at any time during this 9,30 hour flight. We sat in the cabin at our seats with no drinks offered, no water bottle for at least 15 minutes. The crew came by after 15 minutes to offer us a selection of non alcoholic beverages. I declined the drink and was asked if I wanted anything else and I ordered champagne. All drinks during our entire flight were served with no napkin and I thought this to be a bit odd since you get a napkin in Canada even on low cost carriers! Menus were handed out and we were asked for our selection later on. After take off, the service was not well planned. It took a while before any crew member came by and when they did they offered to make our beds! We had just left Montreal at 1045 pm and I suspect this is why they were asking us prior to even taking a drink order! I declined the offer for bedding and informed they that I would be ready for it after dinner. ""Of Course Sir, anything you want"". The response lacked being genuine and I felt the crew was somewhat irked. The service began with handling out a bottle of water, 40 minutes into the flight. We waited another 10 or so minutes and we were asked for drinks. The ""Onboard Chef"" came by to take our food order and this was also done in a chaotic way. He would take the order for 3-5 seats at a time and then disappear. The whole order taking for the entire business class must have taken 40 minutes. The food was served and it was beautifully plated. I can't say the food tasted better than any other overseas carrier I've flown in business class. The onboard chef seemed like it was all a show and I could not really see how he was a chef. He took our order (chefs don't usually do this) and made sure the plates looked nice. I think that is the extent of it and I don't really see any exotic or added value to this.During the whole meal, my drinks went dry for 10 or more minutes at a time. I have flown many carriers in business class and I have never had to ask or get up to ask for more wine with my meal. The crew in the business cabin were simply not friendly nor attentive. I also experienced the Turkish Airlines lounge in Istanbul during my connection. It is tired looking and circus like atmosphere. I qualified for the use of a resting suite. The attendant informed me she would come by to let me know when I could shower. I was there 3 hours, and she never came.",A330 / A321,Business,Business Class,Montreal to Berlin via Istanbul,Feb-19,4,1,3,3,1,1,no
Turkish Airlines,1,K Darzane,17th February 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | In 9/30/2018 my wife, our 11 months old son, and myself took Turkish Airlines to fly from San Francisco to Addis Ababa via Istanbul. Half way in the first leg of the flight (from San Francisco to Istanbul), a lady in the flight got sick and a decision was made to divert the plane to Bergen Norway, so the lady can get a medical treatment. This caused 3 hours delay on our arrival time to Istanbul and we missed our second leg flight (From Istanbul to Addis) as a result. When we first got to Istanbul information was scarce and no one were willing to help. After a lot of leg work we finally reached to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“TransferÃ¢â‚¬Â station where we can request to be booked to another flight. We were told the next flight to Addis Ababa is 24 hours later and the airline will provide hotel accommodations for us. They booked us to the next flight and refer us to another station where we can request hotel accommodation. When we got to the hotel accommodation station, we were told to get a visa and return. When we got to the Visa station we faced discrimination because my wife carried a passport from Ethiopia. Visa was offered to my son and myself who were carrying a US passport and denied to my wife who were carrying Ethiopian passport. When we asked why we were told they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t give Visas to people who carry Ethiopian passport. We showed them my wifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s US green card and explain the situation we will face if we had to stay in the airport with a sick child for 24 additional hours and they still refuse to give my wife a visa. The only solution they offered is to leave my wife who was breastfeeding behind. We tried to call the US Embassy in Istanbul to explain the situation, but they were closed for the day. Out of options, hungry and tired, we finally decide to stay in the airport for the next 24 hours. We returned to Turkish airlines terminal and asked if we get admittance to the Turkish airline lounge, so our child can rest in a comfortable area and this request was denied because we are not Turkish airline business customers. For the next 24 hours, we were prisoners in Istanbul airport. I regret my decision to fly Turkish and I will never fly them again.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Addis Ababa via Istanbul,Sep-18,4,3,4,3,1,1,no
Turkish Airlines,5,M KrÃƒÂ¡lik,17th February 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | My first time on Turkish. It's not a bare-basics, race-to-the-bottom product, but it's far behind Asian carriers and Qatar Airways in warmth and sophistication. There is a lot of confusion both in the cockpit and at the Istanbul transit area. Passengers are given the wrong information. My flight ex-KUL taxied all over the airport for 2 hours before returning to gate for refuelling. (We were just about to take off on a 11.5-hour journey with not enough fuel? Interesting.) That just about put paid to everyone's plans to catch their connecting flights. The gate number for my Geneva flight was different from what the entertainment system showed us right before landing (as I found out after sprinting, laptop and shoes in hand, to the wrong gate). Very stressful. On board, food is okay but same-same across sectors. English is not great unless pre-recorded. Male crew are quite patient and hard-working. The female staff can be pleasant when they want to be. Sadly, many make it very clear that having seen the world and having put peroxide highlights in their hair, pouring coffee in economy class is not where they want tp be. (How hard is it to say ""Good evening"" to a passenger during boarding, instead of giving an icy, silent stare?) In the future, unless I decide to travel to one of the secondary destinations served by TK, such as Salzburg or Lyon, my preference will remain with the more established airlines.",,Business,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Geneva via Istanbul,Feb-19,2,3,4,3,4,4,no

They charged me for a flight but due to system error the funds disappeared from my account without the payment showing in their system.

I complained via the feedback online form and now i am messaging with Turkish Airlines for more than 6 weeks. They refuse to give me any compensation for the stress.

I paid for emergency seat, Turkish Airlines decided to give to someone else the seat - this guy is Turkish Airlines employee - I saw him with joking around with the cabin crew and they also treated him with some business class beverages, so Turkish Airlines is also corrupted.

Turkish Airlines,1,G Larina,10th February 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | I am flying from Vienna to Singapore with a layover in Istanbul for 11 hours. I selected this long layover knowing that I had much shorter routes with the only intention of taking the Sunday 4:00 pm free tour around the city that Turkish Airlines provides to itÃ‚Â´s travelers when they have long wait at the airport. Prior my flight, I confirmed via phone with Turkish Airlines that there was no need to make a reservation and that as long as 1 person would like to make the tour, that would be sufficient to do it and that I needed to be at hotel desk 30 min before the start. As soon as we landed I rushed to the desk office but the passport control took about 50 minutes and I arrived at the desk at 3:50 pm (20 min later than expected). Although I was late, I did see that the tour group was there with the guide, getting ready to leave. I asked at the desk if I could join and they told me ""No, tour is finished"". I was not going to take no for an answer as I had chosen Turkish Airlines and a 11 hours layover flight (instead of 3) to jump on that tour. The manager approached me in a very rude way and told me that she had to leave and that the buses were full. She said that she could put me in the tour but that there was no space for me (in the website clearly states that as long as 1 person will be interested in the tour, it will be arranged). According to her excuse, she had 62 people ready to go and that was exactly the maximum amount that she could take. It is interesting, to say the least, that apparently I was so unlucky that I was the only person that was left out out of an exact number of 62 people. It is really hard to believe that the group of tourist standing next to me at that same moment was 62, when it looked more like 20 people. This person was extremely rude and zero customer oriented and did nothing to help me in that situation or to find an alternative. All she did was to yell at me and say that if I was not happy that I should open a claim (so that's what I'm doing now). I would like to highlight that all I wanted was to do the tour on my way to Singapore and it would have been really easy for her to make it happen. Instead, now I want a compensation.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vienna to Singapore via Istanbul,Feb-19,2,2,,,1,1,no

The departing gate and boarding experience was good, people boarded quickly and the sequence worked well. The cabin of this new 737 was clean and bright, for a economy seat the legroom was ok with a standard seat pitch of 34 or so inches. A cheesy safety video was shown before takeoff featuring lego figures. A little too cheesy after been shown twice, once in Turkish and once in English. Drinks were served after take off in a punctual fashion and was soon followed by a superb in flight meal of lamb kebab and rice, a good looking vegetarian Dahl was available too. Drinks included average wines and rice beer, along with soft drinks and Turkish coffee. The cabin crew where good and well turned out, including a chef working in the galley for business class passengers. The rest of the flight was fine.

Turkish Airlines,1,H Mazaresh,18th January 2019,Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Los Angeles via Istanbul. The estimated departure of TK9 (BOM-IST) was 6:55 am which actually departed at 7:55 am it was delayed because of some connecting flight and other reasons. My experience in both flights form BOM-IST and IST-LAX was way too different. BOM-IST review: Communication: The communication done by the pilot with passengers was awful they spoke something in Turkish and mumbled some English. All I understood was word THANK YOU. The quality of speakers used for the announcement was very cheap. The flight crew had a very different attitude in this flight they didn't communicate well with passengers and was just doing work like robots. Not listening to queries and moving on with next passengers. They didn't even greet their incoming passengers. Food quality was OKish. No menu card was provided. Overall the Flight was clean with old interfaces. My front seat was torn apart with some internals clearly seen. IST-LAX review: The communication was very clear in English the speakers were fine. The cabin crew was friendly and accommodating understood passengers well and heard all my queries. Helped me with my bags. Greeted us while coming in and going out. Food: Food was awful. When given meal preference was an Asian vegetarian meal please for god sake dont serve ITALIAN PASTA. Menu card was provided. Flight: This flight was cleaner with newer interfaces and good seats. The flight arrived 1 hr late. Overall Review of Turkish Airlines: Istanbul airport security lady was extremely rude. She can't even understand basic English. Passengers are in hurry and tired and in that mindset even such small things make a big impact on passengers. My Mumbai to Istanbul flight was awful and Istanbul to Los Angeles was good.

Turkish Airlines,1,Frederick Lansky,17th January 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Kilaminjaro to Chicago via Istanbul. My problems began the day before the flight, I had booked a Turkish Airlines award business class ticket using United Mileageplus miles months earlier, but the day before noticed I couldn't select my seat and part of my flights were missing from the itinerary. I called Turkish Airlines to confirm everything was but for some reason I couldn't select my seat, so to arrive to the airport early. I arrive the next day to the airport 3 hours early in Kiliminjaro airport in Tanzania and it turns out there is a massive problem with my ticket. A Turkish airlines agent later said it was ""it was award ticket and NO REC on your onward boarding pass"""" which I have no idea what it means but the agent was smashing away at the keyboard for hours trying to get me on the flight to the point they had to hold the flight to Istanbul. At the very last minute I was finally I was able to board and the Turkish airlines agent said I shouldn't have any more problems, but once I get to Istanbul I need to get my next boarding pass and that my bag would arrive just fine to Chicago (both of these turned out to be false) Already having a bad day,I was informed that for the duration of the flight I would only receive economy service and meals despite booking a business class ticket. Once I arrived to Istanbul, more problems began as the transfer desks agents were extremely unhelpful just ping ponging me from one desk to the other with no agent willing to print my boarding pass or ticket. As it got closed to boarding time I told a transfer desk agent I'm not leaving until they print me my pass which I paid for and I was bound to miss my flight! In the end a desk agent in Istanbul wrote me ticket by hand 30 minutes before the flight was set to take off and told me to run! This ticket got me past security and it seemed everything was ok until I got to the gate and once again they denied me boarding, while they grabbed my passport and the agents again smashing on a computer keys trying to get me boarded. Then they tried to claim that my ticket was only economy until I showed them the receipt, at this point they were once again, holding the next plane up for me. At the very last second they finally let me board the flight to Chicago. Once arriving to Chicago I was once again greeted with more bad news. My bag had not made it so I asked them to ship the bag to Mexico City (where I live). They said I would need to pick it up at the airport ""the next day."" Well turns out the next day was a whopping 5 days later. When the bag arrived it was completely destroyed. The nightmare doesn't end there. I figured they would be quick to provide compensation over such an incident, especially over an expensive long distance business class ticket but was I wrong. Once I began the process I sent them all relevant details including pictures of my damaged bag, and receipts totalling about $500 for various purchases I had to make for the 5 days I didn't have my bag. Then they said that they couldn't pay me anything for my damaged bag because they needed a ""repair invoice"" when they originally said a financial request will suffice in lieu. At that point I had already thrown my damaged baggage away.",Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Kilaminjaro to Chicago via Istanbul,Dec-18,1,1,1,1,1,1,yes

No storage space. The kit they provided had nothing in it. Cheap stuff. For an around 6 hour flight, no menu cards were provided. The crew serving never bothered to ask if passengers needed anything. One had to look around what others were eating and ask for it. The worst part was the next flight, from Istanbul to Frankfurt. It was again A330-200. And everything on this flight was perfect.

The check-in was fast as there weren't any queue and the staff work very professionally. i received a priority pass at the security. The airport is huge so I need sometime to walk to the gate. I visited the United Airlines lounge near the gate which was large, modern, clean, had friendly staff and had wide selection of food and drinks. After staying in the lounge I headed to the gate early like it said on the time board but I had to wait at the gate very long and the queue as disorganized and passenger both business and economy were held for another half an hour before boarding. After boarding, I got welcomed by the crew handed out a welcome drink and a menu for lunch. The seat was fully flat, modern and comfortable but the remote control was old and the distance to the magazines was unacceptable and the storage areas was poor. The flight was delayed as the traffic at Heathrow was bad. The in-flight entertainment system which had wide selection of movies, TV programs and many more. The meal was served an hour after takeoff, the food made up of Turkish food which was nice but it tasteless and the option in the menu was poor. The toilet was clean and modern.

Turkish Airlines,1,John Mbuli,15th December 2018,"Not Verified | Paris to Dar es Salaam via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines is at best unreliable. The nightmare started in August but let me say all in until I travelled in December I changed the ticket 3 times. Every time 'schedule changes'. Then when I travelled, they lost my bag. When they found it, there was a missing item! I wasn't alone missing a luggage at the airport. Turkish airlines is just very unprofessional. I bought their ticket because of competitive prices, but if I calculate the ticket price and the time and money to call them (because of their issues), I should just have bought a ticket from a superior company like Emirates or Qatar.

Turkish Airlines,5,C Halder,11th December 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Vienna to San Francisco via Istanbul. Flight experience was ok and satisfying. Customer complaints handling a disaster. TK did not credit status miles as on the ticket. But no way to get an answer why. All online contacts tried. Autogenerated answers, refusal to accept messages in language of home page. Refusal of message because form not filled completely (no miles and smiles number, we cannot deal with your message). And last ""You may contact with related Airlines customer service for the transactions"". All from email accounts that would not accept answers. My take is clear: TK does knowingly produce wrong and misleading information on tickets, and laugh at customers asking for remedy for non provided services. Hence, neither me nor any company member I have to authorize will fly TK from now on.",,Business,Business Class,Vienna to San Francisco via Istanbul,Nov-18,4,5,4,3,2,3,no
Turkish Airlines,1,M Famura,10th December 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Istanbul to Los Angeles. Ground crew is just terribly unhappy. Rude and condescending. They are unhappy with their jobs and it shows. None of them actually care about their company which reflects on the leadership. Therefore the customer experience is bad all around. You get what you pay for and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Turkish airlines for you. The incident that prompted this review is the fact that I dropped my glasses. I waited for all the passengers to leave and then started looking for them. As I was looking for them, their crew instead of helping asked me to leave the plane assuring me that they will look for it and bring it to baggage claim. When I reached baggage claim they said wait for a few minutes and we will let you know. Another 15 min go by and they found them, told me to pick them up at the check in counter at departures. So I walk up there and the lady at the desk is just unhappy. She tells me itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be 45 min and they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mail them to me, So I wait. One and half later someone shows up with glasses that are not mine. They said wait till we find more, two more pairs come up and still not mine. Another 45 min go by and nothing. So basically 500 dollar glasses down the drain. Bottom line, if you drop something donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t leave the plane, they will try to push you out and then they wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care. I would say go pay a little more and pick better service. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not that I lost something, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how the crew treated me after having dropped an item that I could have retrieved if they had let me look for it",Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Istanbul to Los Angeles,Dec-18,2,1,2,3,1,1,yes
Turkish Airlines,8,T Merter,8th December 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Turkish Airlines needs to offer transfer service options (maybe even check in at pick up location) like Emirates does if it wants to remain competitive as the current arrangements for the new Istanbul Airport are greatly inadequate. The check-in kiosks are still not operating reliably. TGS staff were present to offer assistance. However I can not see TK moving all operations in less than a month without damaging their overall product and reputation as the new airport still lacks a proper lounge (the Turkish Airlines Corner arrangement although a improvement from a weeks ago still just a makeshift), restaurants, retail and other basic facilities. Boarding conducted in a orderly manner and on-time departure. The 2Ãƒâ€”2 seating business class product on this fairly new 737-800 is as good as it gets with IFE and ample space. The breakfast offering was of good quality with a tasety Turkish cheese selection and cold cuts. The scrambled eggs main dish was average. Very good selection in the bread basket. Attentive crew and smooth landing on time arrival to Baku, which is probably the best airport in the region and a pleasure to fly in to.

I inform level of the temperature to air steward, but not much change. Its better sleep in cooler, because you have blanket, clothes to add on!

Turkish Airlines,3,T Eldem,3rd December 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Ankara to Frankfurt on Turkish Airlines. Quick check in using the priority counter. Following passport control headed to the lounge which was too warm and had the very basic selection of food and beverages. This lounge is worlds away from TKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lounge in Istanbul and one of the worst I have ever visited. The WiFi did not work despite repeated attempts. Headed to the gate well in advance of boarding time and much to my disappointment we were bussed to the aircraft when there were several vacant air bridges. On board the hard product was decent and having chosen an emergency exit row I had plenty of legroom. The service was extremely slow and by the time I received my lunch it was already cold. Food was well below the standard I had come to expect from TK and I see this as a telltale sign of service deterioration. FAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s went about executing their duties as if they were on autopilot. The IFE had a good selection and like my inbound journey, the audio jack did not work well causing frequent loss of audio. The flight departed and arrived on time. Despite being tagged as Ã¢â‚¬Å“PriorityÃ¢â‚¬Â my bag took considerable amount of time to come out and was delivered well after those that were not tagged as such. I have been using TK regularly in recent years and the decline in quality has been steady.

Turkish Airlines,3,T Eldem,30th November 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Frankfurt to Ankara. Checked in well in advance as I was connecting from an overseas flight. The agent had difficulty locating my reservation despite having been presented with an electronic boarding pass and my passport. At the gate, boarded with the priority group given my status on Star Alliance. On board, the hard product looked good and with the exception of my audio jack the seat functions worked well. Following take off we were offered lunch with two options for main course. The food was tasty for economy class and the portions were OK. Several beverage choices including beer, wine and spirits were offered. The IFE had a glitch where every movie choice was directed to the wrong film each time. The seat was comfortable enough for economy. The flight pushed back and landed on time. I have taken multiple international and domestic flights with TK in recent years and as with my previous flights, this one had passengers standing up and walking to the front of the aircraft while taxiing. The FAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s did not force them back to their seats and simply replayed the pre-recorded safety message. As a result, the plane taxied for about 10 minutes with several passengers standing in the aisle and opening overhead bins risking the safety of others around them. Whilst most of my on board experience has been pleasant with TK I am appalled to see that their FAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s do not enforce the most basic safety rules and simply ignore violations. This is a very concerning display of TKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s safety culture and raises questions about the rest of their operations.",Boeing 737,Business,Economy Class,FRA to ESB,Nov-18,3,4,3,1,3,4,no
Turkish Airlines,3,E Genis,30th November 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Ankara to Amsterdam via Istanbul. After a mediocre Business class flight to Turkey with them, we decided to stay at Economy for our flight back. The IFE is pretty good and worked well for me. Food and drinks are also okay. However cabin service was way too slow for a very short ESB-IST flight which over-hastened the eat and drink joy for half of the plane. IST-AMS service was alright, although the food quality is drastically decreasing. Their ground service and staff have major setbacks everywhere, only getting worse. Also, the seat pitch for both flights were literally terrible - barely 30 inches each. Their economy seat pitch does not put them above the category of low-cost carriers. They used to be my favorite airline, not anymore. I no longer prefer them if I have another major airline option on any route.",A319-200 / A330-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ankara to Amsterdam via Istanbul,Nov-18,2,3,3,5,1,2,no
Turkish Airlines,8,J Vreugdenhil,26th November 2018,"Not Verified | Amsterdam via Istanbul to Havana return. I'm really satisfied with the overall performance of THY. The seat pitch is quite good. A lot of choices and a very good responsive personal entertainment system, the food is really good and the quantity of the food they offered you is certainly enough. You receive an amenity kit on the long haul flight, which is a nice touch. There is live television and WiFi on board, but the Wifi was quite expensive. The live television worked perfect, I could watch a live soccer match! Downside is that the crew sometimes a bit tired looks and act. The layover in Istanbul is a bit chaotic. My bags arrived in Havana and also on the way back in Amsterdam. My conclusion is that Turkish Airlines offers a good product, when you compare it with the price.

Turkish Airlines,1,Keith Moore,26th November 2018,"Not Verified | Dublin to Phuket via Istanbul. Boarding queuing up everyone in the queue for a while they decided to call rows out we were nearly first going in and nearly last by the end not a good start, went down hill from there on. Seats mixed up even though we asked for certain seats luckily some people swapped with us - we asked one one of the staff could they please sort the seats out, they didn't care. We had to do it ourself as we have 2 small daughters not sitting beside us. Nothing for kids no kids menu or kids toys or colouring books to keep them entertained for the flights. .The staff from Istanbul to Phuket were the worst most miserable people we have ever came across on a flight.

Turkish Airlines,6,EY Genis,25th November 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Ankara via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines is a difficult airline to review with varying ups and downs. Business cabin is pretty good with comfortable seating but without an all-aisle access layout that misses window seats for this. IFE screen size and selection is very good but there was a problem with my system which had to be rebooted for 3 times and I could only start a movie near the end of the flight, and I could not finish of course. Although not perfect, cabin service is good, but ground service is undeniably terrible. I barely could catch my transit flight after a very long, chaotic and totally unassisted sweaty rush from one side of Ataturk Airport to the other. Many airlines, mostly from Asia, set the bar to a very high level recently which clearly pushes Turkish into a way lower tier for such treats. I would not pay a dime extra for Business and straightly prefer Economy class with this airlines, especially for short and mid hauls.",A330-200,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Amsterdam to Ankara via Istanbul,Nov-18,5,4,5,3,1,2,no
Turkish Airlines,1,Christelle Nasrany,24th November 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Istanbul to Beirut. My flight with Turkish airlines was my worst experience ever. We were a group of 6 people travelling together and it happened that we faced many problems due to the disorganization of the airport and the airline. To start with, we arrived about 2 hours and a half earlier than our flight to the airport. We had to wait like more than half an hour for the passport control due to the congestion, noting that not all counters were available. Then, the staff were shouting on us to remove our shoes and get in the scanner machine and all do not speak English so we had many difficulties to understand what they want. How come that an international airport has only Turkish speaking staff, and rude staff. Next, we went to check in with tax refund process, and here, in this airport happens what does not happen in any airport in the world: They need to check your baggage, you have to open and search for the items in the airport in order to have your invoices stamped. What a shame. We got delayed due to this process, but still we were safe and on time. Due to the disorganization and the non helpful staff who were shouting on us and telling us to move faster when scanning our items, we lost a cell phone. We were told we had to go to the lost and found office and everyone you ask in this airport tells you to go in wrong directions so we got lost. We lost lots of time and we arrived at the gate 15 mins earlier, after running miles and miles to reach our gate after 15 mins of running. The staff taking care of checking passports was still available in the gate but refused to check our passports since boarding had ended 2 mins ago. We had to buy new tickets, even though we were at the airport and we checked in on time. Concerning Turkish airlines, we were told that we had to pay only the fare rates which is not too much because we are transferring our tickets, and we were surprised to know that the fare rates were higher than a brand new ticket. So we bought new tickets for all of us. Also to mention that we were told by the transfer desk of Turkish airlines and by the sales office of Turkish airlines that our bags were unloaded and they will be transferred to our new ticket. However, our bags arrived to Beirut with the flight that we missed, and when we were complaining about our bags they did not help us and were insisting that the bags are still in Turkey, till we showed them the pictures of our bags with our parents in Beirut, who managed to take them from Beirut international airport. This was my worst flight ever, I didn't receive any help from anyone in the airport and anyone from the Turkish Airline staff, but I was always told wrong information and sent in wrong directions and even my bags were not organized to stay and arrive with my new flight. This flight and this airport is never to be recommended.",A330,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Istanbul to Beirut,Nov-18,2,2,2,1,1,1,yes
Turkish Airlines,3,Neil Kotak,22nd November 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | London to Kigali via Istanbul. This airline customer service team letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s it down. If you have any issues, they simply wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help you. Before, during or after the flight. If you complain they simply donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t respond and if they do itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a very blunt rude answer. I tried reaching out to this airline via Facebook, phone, email and linked in and they actually ignored me. This airline tried to charge me Ã‚Â£27 per extra kg when I told them I was taking donations across for kids in Uganda. My friends luggage got lost and they offered him nothing and didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t return any of his emails or calls whilst we were away!

Turkish Airlines,8,Stephen Brunette,21st November 2018,"Not Verified | I flew from Izmir to Montreal via Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. I hadn't flown Turkish in 4 years, and was a little worried because of some of the reviews I have read. I had nothing to worry about. The flight was excellent from Izmir to Istanbul on a B777, even time for a small sandwich and coffee on the 1 hour flight. As usual, not enough gates at Ataturk airport, and we were bussed to the domestic terminal. This should be a thing of the past when Turkish Airlines moves to the New Istanbul Airport in early January 2019. A quick walk over to the International terminal and then boarded my flight to Montreal on a A330-300. The flight crew was excellent and had a good grasp of english. They were friendly and helpful. The infotainment system on Turkish is excellent with a wide assortment of movies, tv shows, and I loved the live TV. Two very tasty meals, a good selection of drinks, and snacks available in the galley throughout the flight. The restrooms were kept clean throughout the flight as I could see the flight attendants checking them often and cleaning if needed. The return flights were the same, excellent staff, bathrooms kept clean, food was very tasty. The only downside was having to be bussed to the International Terminal at Ataturk and it was pouring rain, the stairs had no cover. One of my bags didn't make the transfer to Izmir in Istanbul, but I reported it to Turkish Ground Services in Izmir, and it was promptly delivered the next morning.

Turkish Airlines,8,Murat Polat,17th November 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Istanbul to Montreal. The boarding process was interesting. Firstly, you cannot do online check-in as they need to check your passport. After going through airport security twice, when you go to the gate you go through another security check. After that, some people were sitting behind the boarding desk while we were waiting for the plane as there weren't enough seats and the crew was pretty pissed about it even though they initially didn't say anything about them being there. Once boarded, everything was smooth again. I love the new Turkish in-flight safety video. There were a couple of new movies that I watched on the IFE system. They still have random episodes of TV Series which is interesting. The food was better than usual, with ground beef stuffed eggplant, rice and tzatziki sauce. The second meal they served (Mac and Cheese) was alright as well. I usually like Turkish's food, but this time I was actually impressed as they somehow outdid themselves.

Turkish Airlines,7,T Merter,10th November 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | I was rather underwhelmed by the new Istanbul Airport. To say that the airport resembled a construction site would be a understatement. TK has a few check-in counters operational for limited international operations. Self check-in kiosks were not available yet. No fast track either for security or passport control. No lounge, just a makeshift arrangement with limited service. Quite a major step backwards to the current arrangement for B/C and TK FFs at Ataturk airport. The terminal also rather unremarkable compared to other major hubs around the globe. Boarding uneventful and not very organized in typical TGS fashion. On board TK is very good as usual. Excellent breakfast served with inspiring menu and attentive crew. The hard product also very good with 2x2 seating, IFE and fresh looking cabin on this relatively new 737-800. On time departure and arrival.

Through security - seems to have modern systems which speed up the process. As yet they don't have their Business Class lounge open. Instead was invited to a small cafe where various complimentary items were offered. Served by two extremely courteous young guys. Boarding on time. During the flight a hot light meal served.

Cabin crew were professional and efficient in meal and drinks services. Enjoyed the safety video, if a bit cheesy! Some downsides would be only adequate leg room for a 6'3"" man like myself, expensive on board WIFI ($9.99 for a hour) and cabin crew turning a blind eye to foolhardy impatient passengers who insisted on getting up and opening the overhead lockers while the plane was still taxiing!

Turkish Airlines,9,Tianhao Xu,14th October 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Lvov to Johannesburg via Istanbul. The first leg was flown by a A321. Check-in was smooth and efficient. The plane seemed to be pretty old, with an old school PTV - there is PTV, but it's not touchscreen nor anything on demand, you could only choose from the few existing channels. Since it's a flight less than 2 hours so it's not a big problem. A excellent light meal was served. I had a long layout in Istanbul so I left the airport for a while. Istanbul airport was a bit crowded, that's why the new airport is opening soon. The next flight, IST-JNB, is on a A333. The food was also good - probably the best food I've ever had in economy, but there's only one option if you didn't book special meal, so it might be a problem with some people.

Turkish Airlines,1,Benedict Jones,12th October 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | We have just returned from our honeymoon to Mauritius of which we flew from London to Mauritius via Istanbul. When we checked into the flight (hours before departure) at London Heathrow, we mentioned that we were on our honeymoon to request some good seats or potential recognition of this monuments trip which is typically offered by other airlines. What followed was both underwhelming, and, quite frankly, offensive. On the 9 hour outbound flight between Istanbul and Mauritius, we were told at check-in that we would be allocated an entire Central row as the flight was not full, so we were individually allocated seats 15D and 15G (as the plane had 4 seats in the central row). Instead of being allocated the row as promised by the check-in attendant, seats 15E and 15F were allocated to two other passengers meaning that not only was this trivial attempt at recognition of our honeymoon trip not honoured, but we had to sit apart for the entire 9 hour journey to Mauritius! We were also told that we could not change seats even by the cabin crew when I spoke with them. A similar lack of empathy for our honeymoon was demonstrated by Turkish Airlines on our return journey also. In summary, if you are planning for a special trip (E.g. A honeymoon), I would strongly recommend choosing another airline as Turkish Airlines knowingly separated us for our outbound trip.

One of the best airlines I had the pleasure to fly with, offering great catering on board, even Chardonay white wine and very friendly cabin crew.

Turkish Airlines,1,Jacques Batimba,8th October 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | I flew back from Yaounde to Washington Airport but my luggage never arrived. At their counter, they initially told me that they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know where my luggage was and made me filled out a claim. Few days later I received a notice that my luggage and will be sent to me in Florida. I finally picked it up at the FEDEX on 09/29 center where I found out some irregularities: my suitcase was damaged, my digital camera and camera were missing, few pairs of shoes were missing as well as some souvenirs from my trip. I immediately called the customer service the same day to make aware of the situation but their customer care is in Romania and claimed that they could not do anything. They referred me to their website. I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have time to do so because homework and my business trip the next week from 10/01-10/05. When I got back on 10/06, I filed a claim and Turkish Airlines sent me a standard message reading: ""Firstly, we would like to apologize to you for the irregularity you have suffered. Pursuant to the transportation regulations, any irregularities in relation to baggage must be communicated to our Company in writing, within 7 days at the latest. Therefore, we would like to inform you that we could not response your request positively. We wish you not to encounter suchlike irregularities, kind regards"". First my luggage arrived 7 days later.

Turkish Airlines,4,J Ragoros,6th October 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Istanbul to Vienna. Most arrogant airline I have ever seen. Asking people to be at the gate 1 hour prior to boarding, which then usually starts 10-20 minutes prior to departure. Sometimes only at the time of departure. No information from gate staff, never, whatsoever. Never apologizes for delay, simply never. Seat pre-booking doesnt work. E-boarding pass can not be issued for flights starting outside Turkey usually, so you need to pick up at the check in counter anyway and do the queue (we have 2018). Unfortunately, for my route, these guys are the best option in terms of connection and times, but its really a pain and annnoying as hell.",,Business,Economy Class,Istanbul to Vienna,Oct-18,3,3,3,4,1,3,yes
Turkish Airlines,1,J Lim,26th September 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Istanbul to Neveshir. This is a follow-up to my review first posted on 23rd Sept 2018. Well as it turns out, first impressions didn't quite last. Any frequent traveler would have experienced a delay in baggage arrival before, and this had to happen to us on this leg of the trip as well. Simple procedure right? Not with Turkish. While even other budget airlines can provide a proper and decent PIR (Property Irregularity Report), they couldn't. We went to the lost & found offices of 3 airports in turkey - Istanbul, Kayseri and Nevsehir, all of them got us to ""contact a different department"", bla bla bla, basically shrugging off responsibility and bringing us all over the world. When the baggage finally arrived at our hotel, it was an 18 hour delay. That's normal. What wasn't normal was that there were no forms to sign to acknowledge receipt of the baggage! The handling company said that ""we are a third party engaged by the airline"" and there was nothing to sign! While outsourcing of such responsibilities are normal, all other courier companies have let me sign a document at the point of collection to acknowledge receipt as well as to document the time of baggage arrival. So the story continues. When we finally managed to get our hands on a PIR, it was a computer generated one with no letterhead, no company stamp and no signature. A 9-year old could have reproduced the same document using MS word. Most importantly, it did not even state the eventual time of baggage arrival. How is any insurance company going to process a claim if a PIR does not state the time of baggage arrival? So now we are going around the world, from one department to another to yet another again, just to get our hands on a proper PIR.

In a narrowbody aircraft type we weren't expecting any IFE, but much to our pleasant surprise, there was and a huge international selection at that! Even though it was barely a 2 hour flight, it made the experience a lot more comfortable. Check in counters were smooth and efficient and did their job well. Seat pitch presented a decent amount of legroom for a narrowbody plane. Breakfast served was delicious too, and with metal cutlery no less! First time on Turkish and I'm impressed.

Turkish Airlines,9,Philip Browne,22nd September 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Manchester to Ercan via Istanbul. Check in at Manchester was fast and efficient in business class, the reason for that would become apparent later. Plane was due to depart at 1100 but when we went to the gate as advised, the inbound passengers were not being allowed to deplane as the next gate along was loading for departure and presumably the staff were worried that the passengers might get confused. Eventually, we boarded and found we had the business class cabin to ourselves. Plane left 45 minutes late and the service during the flight was, as to be expected, superb. Food was good and tasty and we were able to sleep on this section. The cabin crew were very good. Because of the delay, we were short of time in Istanbul and were ushered straight to our next flight bypassing security. The flight from Istanbul to Ercan was aboard a A321 with the 2+2 seating layout. Boarding for this flight was chaotic as is normal for this airport. The flight was only 1 hour 20 minutes so it was not too bad, but premium economy would be a better description of the business class cabin. The seats were not particularly comfortable and the seat adjust buttons did not seem to work. The meal on this flight was superb.

Turkish Airlines,3,Elisabetta Mancini,18th September 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Our flight from Venice to Nairobi provided a two-hour stopover in Istanbul. Two weeks before departure we were advised that the flight to Istanbul Nairobi had been anticipated and that therefore we would have had only one hour of call but that we would have done it easily (before confirming the acceptance of the flight change, we talked with the customer service Turkish who gave us confirmation - I hope that the phone calls are recorded, as well as an email in which we confirmed that we would have made it). As expected, the flight from Venice to Istanbul leaves late. We get off the plane at 18.05. The flight to Nairobi would leave at 18.40 but already on the panel appeared written ""gate closed"". We go to the gate and at 18.15 we are there the flight was due to leave at 18.40) and the gate is actually closed and the plane has already left. They send us to a desk for customer support that is not the right one and we find out after 10 minutes of waiting thanks to another customer who warns us. After having gone through 3 Turkish desk (Ataturk airport is not really small ...) we arrive at the correct one where in an absolutely rude manner they warn us that we would have to wait 24 hours for the next plane. Without baggage. They still give us assistance by providing us with a hotel and full board. They ask us if we prefer it near the airport or the center of istanbul and we ask that it be the center. They make us get on a bus without telling us where we were going and leave us in a hotel near the airport ... no ifs and buts, without even the foresight to say: sorry in the center was all full. We lose 24 hours of vancaza, the hotel booked in Nariobi, the various visits etc. ruined holiday. We are asking for a refund. They are denying it. saying that we agreed to have only 1 hour stopover: we agreed to have 1 hour of call, true - we never agreed to lose the connection. (mail and turkish phone calls in hand) we go ahead and we do not give up. (nothing to complain about the convenience of flight, meals etc, all unexceptionable). IT: l nostro volo da Venezia a Nairobi prevedeva uno scalo di due ore ad Istanbul. Due settimane prima della partenza siamo stati avvisati che il volo Istanbul Nairobi era stato anticipato e che quindi avremmo avuto solo un'ora di scalo ma che ce l'avremmo fatta agevolmente (prima di confermare l'accettazione del cambio volo, abbiamo parlato con il customer service Turskish che ci ha dato conferma - spero che le telefonate siano registrate, oltre che ad una mail in cui ci confermavano che ce l'avremmo fatta). Come c'era da aspettarsi, il volo da Venezia ad Istanbul parte in ritardo. Scendiamo dall'aereo alle 18.05. Il volo per Nairobi sarebbe partito alle 18.40 ma giÃƒÂ sul pannello compariva scritto ""gate closed"". Ci fiondiamo al gate e alle 18.15 siamo lÃƒÂ¬ (ribadisco il volo sarebbe dovuto partire alle 18.40) ed il gate ÃƒÂ¨ effettivamente chiuso e l'aereo ÃƒÂ¨ anche giÃƒÂ partito. Ci mandano ad un desk per assistenza clienti che non ÃƒÂ¨ quello corretto e lo scopriamo dopo 10 minuti di attesa grazie ad un'altra cliente che ci avvisa. Dopo per essere passati per 3 desk Turkish ( l'aeroporto Ataturk non ÃƒÂ¨ proprio piccolo... ) arriviamo a quello corretto dove in maniera assolutamente sgarbata ci avvisano che avremmo dovuto aspettare 24 ore per l'aereo successivo. Senza bagaglio. Ci danno comunque assistenza fornendoci un albergo e pensione completa. Ci chiedono se lo preferiamo vicino all'aeroporto o al centro di istanbul e chiediamo che sia il centro. Ci fanno salire su di un pulmino senza dirci dove stessimo andando e ci lasciano in un albergo vicino all'aeroporto ... senza se e senza ma, senza neanche l'accortezza di dire: ci spiace in centro era tutto full. Perdiamo 24 ore di vancaza, l'albergo prenotato a Nariobi, le varie visite etc. vacanza rovinata. Stiamo chiedendo il rimborso. Ce lo stanno negando. dicendo che abbiamo accettato di avere solo 1 ora di scalo: abbiamo accettato di avere 1 ora di scalo, vero. non abbiamo mai accettato di perdere la coincidenza.

The worst customer service, the worst ground crew service, the worst assistance I have ever experienced. We requested mobility assistance and the customer service reassured us that it is already fixed. When we arrived in Istanbul airport, the flight crew who assisted me get off the plane just left us without any explanation or instruction. We were clueless where should we go and where should we wait. When we asked an airport staff, he just told us in a rude manner to stay where we are and wait for the assistance for the next flight. We were so unsure and worried so we asked again a ground crew if there is an assistance coming to help me. I am handicapped and cannot walk so we really need this assistance. Boarding time is 1:05 am and it was already 12:50 and no help came. We just went to the gate by ourselves.

United Airlines,1,M Garten,18th February 2019,Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | As with all budget airlines the staff treat customers poorly. This was disgusting from the booking process. I am a high status star alliance member. But get treated poorly from beginning to end. Their website is a broken mess. I was absolutely unable to make the booking on the website. So I ring in. The price immediately goes up. They force me to do a currency conversion. But then just up the price. And charge me in USD at a higher price. Then I have to pay international fees anyway. But they don't charge me once. 8 times on this one flight I have now had. And the person messes up the booking so bad I have had to make many many phone calls to try fix it. I almost missed the flight because of incompetence of the check in staff. And again I am high status star alliance. So was at the premium check in desk. Came within minutes of missing the flight because of staff incompetence. Didn't get lounge access. Gate staff were surly and uncommunicative. I was trying to find out when the flight would actually take off. To go buy food or visit the toilet. Absolutely unsuccessful. Not bording star alliance customers with United star alliance customers. Entertainment system was broken. Power plug was broken. I paid extra for this SMH charging for services and not rendering. The flight was so late I almost missed my connection. There was absolutely no support from staff to assist me getting to my next flight. Missed the lounge again Same issues at gate. Staff just don't care. With the previous issues I had really hoped to go buy some food and visit a toilet. All of this was quite a way to go. So I sat at the gate. Broken seat. Extremely uncomfortable seat. Broken entertainment. The food. If you could call it that. Was disgusting. It really is the worst food I have seen on international flight. Couldn't even get a snack. I really enjoyed 30 hours without food and barely a toilet Break. United used to be the best.

United Airlines,1,Timothy Gentry,14th February 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Cancun to San Francisco. The absolute worst airline I have ever flown. I booked these flights months ago and have literally had nothing but problems since. To start out after well over twelve hours between on the phone and Facebook messenger (because god forbid they actually respond on the post they send you a private message to try and resolve. After all this time they said they had everything fixed then when we go to finally start our vacation they changed seats on my wife and I and we were no longer together (oh yeah and they were no help again) next flight was fine from Houston the CancÃƒÂºn. Leaving CancÃƒÂºn to San Francisco they told us to just keep our Duty Free with us that they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need it. Upon arriving to San Francisco we are told we have to collect our bags and recheck them - and we have to be able to fit 4 bottles of alcohol in 1 checked bag that was already over stuffed. (United also charges for every checked back so no I know why, they get to make another 50.00 for an additional checked bag), after being sent to several different representatives by United personnel we ended up 30 minutes later back to the same one who gladly checked another bag (at that wonderful charge) My United Mileage Plus card will be cancelled tomorrow. United Airlines is absolutely horrible, they will take more and more and give the consumer less each time. Oh by the way CancÃƒÂºn to San Francisco left at almost 6:00 p.m. and was 6 hours they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even offer a snack.

United Airlines,8,James Wallace,12th February 2019,"Not Verified | Sydney to Houston. I was told that I could use either the Singapore or Air New Zealand Lounge. I chose the Singapore Lounge and enjoyed the bacon and eggs and Champagne at 9:45 am. The Business cabin seating is 2-2-2, which makes sleeping on one's side and back comfortable but very tight when sleeping on my front. There was an excellent selection of movies to chose from. The salad was very small and no food was served for a good eleven hours--just lunch after takeoff and breakfast before landing. I would suggest more options in the galley. The fasten seatbelt sign came on many times during the flight with the recorded announcement, ""please fasten your seatbelt."" I was really happy that they did not make announcements in a second or third language which can make sleeping with United very difficult. The flight attendants did a good job and had a sense of humor but it was an older crew.

United Airlines,1,G Meares,2nd February 2019,Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | I booked this ticket exactly a week ago. The app told me it was a 92% that the plane is on time. So of course I get to Houston just to find out the plane is late due to maintenance. I purposely chose this flight because it landed at 3 and i worked at 5. But now my flight does not arrive in TPA until 4. So now I do not have a ride and the Uber home is 45$. I have already paid 354.82$ with no carry on just so I could get out of the airport quickly. The ladies at the desk in Houston were so rude asking me why I am questioning them and they do not provide ground transportation. I contacted customer service only for her to tell me file the claim and they will get back to me in 7 days. After this I went to the customer service desk located in section C in the Houston airport. The gentleman there was the kindest and reassured me I would get reimbursed for something because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a plane issue which means itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s United fault but I cannot handle the situation until I get to Tampa. So now my options are a 45$ Uber or I have no way of getting home. As I walk the hallways I see signs saying United #1 in on time departures and then I get to the website and see there are so many complaints about flight delays and not because of weather.

We were to late to board, but they said it doesn't matter as the flight was going to be canceled for bad weather. When the flight was canceled we decided to drive to Rapid City, we requested our carry-on luggage which we should of had with us if but United took it from us. It took United Airlines 3 hours and 15 minutes to get the luggage from the canceled flight to the claim area. The staff was rude and uncaring, they said it can take up to 4 hours. Not 1 United employee apologized in any way for the canceled flight or the delay in retrieving our luggage. We paid $328.80 per ticket and United Airlines gave us a measly $101.94 back as a refund, for a flight they never provided. United Airlines service is terrible and they will rip you off!

But where I am annoyed is that they automatically transferred the flight to a flight to Houston. I specifically asked the bag check to not put my bag on that flight seeing as though I decided to stay another night and try a flight the next day - but they went ahead and sent my luggage to Houston anyways. And said they couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t send it back, that it would be sent to Chicago. So IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m stranded here with none of my things, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m pregnant, and this is just flat out unacceptable.

We arrived early for our 5.50 pm flight out of O'Hare to Tampa, and saw a 2.25 pm flight traveling the same route. We checked with a desk agent as to whether getting on that flight might be an option, and she kindly did a quick check to see if there were any seats. She told us we might have a good chance to get on but we needed to hurry to the gate where the flight was scheduled to load. It was quite a hike but we made it to the 2.25 pm flight gate. The first staff member we met seemed confused about our request, but we had received an email from United indicating that fees were not being charged to change flights due to weather so he eventually put us on Stand-By. While he was working on the Stand-By tickets, we struck up a conversation with the supervisor of the desk - and that's what impressed us. She was very cordial and gracious. She kindly asked us to give her a few minutes to see what she could work out and in a couple of minutes she called us up and had two tickets, and noted she was able to find two seats together for us on the flight.

United Airlines,5,Y Han,29th January 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Early evening departure from Narita on Dreamliner (B787-800). Upgraded 2 days before to Economy plus seats. Boarding was efficient, and we departed on time. Economy plus seats gave additional legroom, and this was much appreciated. The 3-3-3 configuration is a little cramped width-wise, you just have to hope that your fellow passengers are on the petite size. Seats were equipped with headrests, but no foot-rests. Blankets and pillow provided, and earphones. IFE was pretty good - sharp, touch screen, reasonable selection of movies and TV shows and even an eclectic relaxation channel. Downside was audio - no selectable tracks, just a series of themed audio tracks which meant you just have to leave it on and wait for songs to appear. Food choices ranged from tolerable to OK, basically it's calories to sustain you. Crew ranged from relatively indifferent to briskly efficient. The Dreamliner made it a little more tolerable, with reduced noise levels even in economy. The biggest downside was that despite the adequate legroom, I found it really hard to get comfortable in the chairs - I can't explain it. Perhaps a combination of thin padding and/or compressed width? At the end, it was a flight to be endured rather than enjoyed, but perhaps that is a good outcome for a United flight.",Boeing 787-8,Business,Economy Class,Tokyo to Denver,Jan-19,2,3,3,4,4,3,no
United Airlines,2,D Perser,27th January 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | San Francisco to Buffalo via Chicago. First- I was charged $30 and forced to check a carry on. You can only bring a small bag that fits under your seat- backpack type size. People that were boarding with say a purse and a shoulder bag were spoken to rudely about it and forced to put purse inside bag in front of a camera? Ticket taker said to next guy who had one small bag Ã¢â‚¬Å“I see you read the memo.Ã¢â‚¬Â And they laughed. So demeaning and unnecessary. This was boarding in San Francisco 35 minutes late btw. People were going to miss connecting flights - but the women with a purse that clearly would fit in her other bag were the important issue. I get to Chicago, find my gate- Grateful I only have 40 minutes to sit. About 15 minutes before scheduled boarding the attendant informs us there is a 2 hour delay due to the fact that the plane is not functioning or something like that. Not sure he could have shown less interest. I know - donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t shoot the messenger- but this was 7:15 am, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure everyone had been traveling as I had, and now needed to find some awful airport food to get through the new timeline.

I must say the flight back was good and that will be posted in a different review but this one was appalling. We were in the first row and had a birds eye view of the flight attendant having what I will call a bad hair day. She put her long, stringy hair in bun, let it down and put it up again and so on a few times. That wasn't so bad but at least twice she ran her fingers through her hair and dropped dislodged hairs and goodness only know what else directly onto the cabin floor! I can't believe it but she did. I never saw her wash her hands and yes she served meals too. The breakfast was supposed to be eggs Benedict. Well there was no poached egg, it resembled a scrambled mishmash and the Hollandaise sauce was baked into the egg instead of being a sauce.

United Airlines,1,W Tang,20th January 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Madison to Newark via Chicago. This morning, I arrived at the airport and waited in line to check my bag for 25 minutes. Once I finally got up to the counter the agent at my desk disappeared for another 15 minutes. She finally came back but said I would miss my flight because I was a few minutes late from the checked baggage cutoff time. The agent tried rebooking my ticket for me. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sure if she was new or wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t trained on the system well enough because it took her a long time to rebook the ticket to the point where her supervisor had to jump in. Her supervisor told her to push me to the side and said that they would Ã¢â‚¬Å“deal with me laterÃ¢â‚¬Â. I waited another 20 minutes for them to get through the rest of the line. Once I finally got my ticket rebooked, the flight is not only not a direct flight, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also supposed to reach my destination 8 hours after my initial flight. First of all, I shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have had been put on hold just because thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a long line to get through. Secondly, right before I was pushed to the side, the agent promised to put me on the next possible flight at 11 am. But after being pushed aside, I got put on the 1:50 pm flight. The inconsistency and empty promising is so unacceptable. I am being lied to and neglected by your staff. I have never experienced this with other airlines. Delta next door had the same amount of people in line and they got through the line 30 minutes faster than United. Delta in the past had allowed me to board my airplane still while my baggage goes on the next flight but United would not allow me to do that. I have lost 8 hours of my time to spend with my parents whom I have not seen in 2 years due to the your staffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incapability to work efficiently. How could you possibly ever replace this valuable time I lost because of your inconsiderate employees. Thanks to United, I will now have 5 hours to cry at the airport.

The food was fine, nothing to write home about, and the entertainment was okay, a few too many Ã¢â‚¬ËœoldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ movies for my liking. The flight attendants were old and a bit abrupt, not overly friendly but not rude. I did notice the seats did not recline back very far, which was not ideal on a flight you have to sleep on.

American Airlines,1,D Clark,18th January 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | I initially chose American Airlines because it was the cheapest flight available. I had never flown with American Airlines before, but I expected the experience to at least be on par with United Airlines. However, I was quickly turned off by this airline upon entering the aircraft. All of the flight attendants were beyond rude. They were basically yelling at passengers to sit down, and they were condescending about the most routine of things. Besides the horrendous attendants, the plane was so crammed. You can tell that they are trying to cram as many people on the plane as possible with no care for passenger's space or comfort. I had just flown on a Japan Airlines domestic flight, and the American Airline flight cannot compare to the space and comfort of that domestic flight.

After repeatedly delaying, then cancelling my flight over a five hour period during which I sat at the airport and watched others placed on flights, American was unable to even find a flight to Dallas on their airline. Instead I was told that I had to drive to another airport at my own expense, board a plane on a different airline to get to Oklahoma City, and once in Oklahoma City, pay for a rental car at my own expense so I could drive another hour in below zero Fahrenheit conditions to reach Stillwater, OK. I had specifically bought a ticket from Houston to Stillwater to avoid driving and spent nearly $200 on the rental car. And it took me nearly 12 hours from my arrival at the airport to reach my destination. The only feedback from American after my horrible experience was basically ""sorry, we can't control the weather, so we refuse to compensate you for your time, inconvenience, or rental car.""

American Airlines,1,Beverly Meister,13th January 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Very disappointing long flight to Narita Japan from Dallas Fort Worth. I had bought my tickets 4 weeks prior and had paid to upgrade from/to Japan. Upon arriving at DFW for the return flight, the status of the flight on the American Airlines official website was listed as ""On Time"". Upon checking in at airport, I was moved to economy class and told I would be reimbursed. Attendant at counter told me the flight was late from Miami (original destination) enroute to DFW. I pleaded unsuccessfully with assigned seat. Inside the cabin, the seats were in a two-three-two configuration. I noticed the seats were old and deteriorated. The TV/Entertainment did not work. My overhead light did not work either! Can you imagine? A thirteen hour scheduled flight! Tried to use my iPad but was not able to watch movies either. I read my book, listened to music with my I-Pad. Due to fight being completely full, it was hard to sleep. The food was terrible compared to the flight from Japan to the US. Yes, I was reimbursed, however, I wonder what was the point in pre-paying for premium economy 4 weeks ahead and then ending up with what I was trying to prevent in the first place? Very disappointed.

American Airlines,10,M Irving,12th January 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | First time I have flown with American Airlines as I usually fly United to the US. Flew from London Heathrow to Chicago ORD. Fare was on offer so I flew American Business class to the US and British Airways First Class back to the UK. Checking in - Heathrow airport I arrived at 05.30, the check in desks did not open until 06.00 for an 08.40 flight. I was aware of the desk opening times so waiting was not a problem. There was a dedicated check in desk for business passengers and when I arrived there was only one other couple in front of me. Check in quick and efficient. No problems encountered. As I was flying business class I was informed that I could use the fast track security lane and make use of the American Airlines lounge. Boarding as with all major airlines boarding was the usual, Family's with children, Passengers that require help / more time followed by business class. On boarding I was direct to my seat and once seated asked if I would like a drink, went for Champagne (very nice too). Flight attendants very attentive, refilling my glass when it became empty. Inflight entertainment, for business class passengers on the 767 you are given a Samsung tablet and Bose headphones. Great choice of films & TV on the tablet only minor niggle is that the tablet is taken back about an hour before landing so a bit annoying if you are halfway through a decent film, also I am not sure how passengers who do not use tablets would of managed. Seat - I found the seat comfortable enough, plenty of leg room. As this was a morning flight I did not feel the need to make use of the lie flat feature so I cannot comment. The seat is controlled via a touch panel and it seems a bit sensitive as while resting my arm on the side the seat started to change position, I did this a couple of times until I placed something over the panel to prevent me from altering my seat layout accidently. I was seated in 4A a window seat. Landing luggage was through fairly quickly again no issues were encountered.

American Airlines,1,G Ince,10th January 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | I've often heard that American Airlines is bad from reading reviews, but after my most recent trip from San Francisco to Tokyo through Los Angeles and back, I can confidently say that I will not book a flight with AA again, ever. My trip to and fro were full of issues. I chose a morning flight at 7am since the ticket was cheaper, and and got to SFO at 5am, while thinking that I was giving myself ample time before departure. I was badly mistaken. When I got there, I saw a long line of more than 40 people queuing. The American Airlines check-in staff were rude and unsympathetically telling people in the queue who have missed their 6am flight that there's nothing they can't do about it, although the problems were due to their slow service. When checking in using the self check-in kiosk, I had problems scanning my passport, the kiosk asked me to verify my travel documents despite my having an Indonesian passport and traveling to Indonesia, and it ran out of paper to print my luggage tags. Many of the check-in kiosks were unresponsive and no one was there to fix it. IFE was the only decent thing they had, their screens are surprisingly capacitive, which allows much better interaction with your fingers. Inflight cabin attendants were impolite. My return flight wasn't a better experience. Upon arriving at LAX after a 7-hour and 9-hour flight, I was told that my LAX to SFO flight was canceled and of course there's nothing American Airlines can do about it besides rebooking my flight to the next day (which they can't even do automatically), and I didn't like that since I have to get back to work the next day. I had to drive back from LA to SF after my 20 hour trip, while jet-lagged. Seriously, avoid American Airlines like the plague. Also, lesson learned, try to avoid flights that have domestic transits.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,SFO to NRT via LAX,Jan-17,1,1,1,2,1,1,no

I arrived at Toronto Pearson Airport last night on American Airlines. My luggage didn't arrive. I went to baggage services and they gave me a phone number to call the next day. I called this morning and the customer service agent told me that my luggage is still in Miami. They are not sure when it will get here. I have my medication in that luggage and now I have to go out of my way to purchase more. Amercian Airlines doesn't even provide any compensation for these sort of mistakes.

American Airlines,1,Niccole Liriano,6th January 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Flying with American Airlines from Miami to La Guardia, New York has been the most frustrating and disappointing experience I have ever had traveling. The staff are rude and uneducated and they have many staff members who only speak one language (which makes it really difficult to communicate). I arrived late to my flight in Miami because I was on a previous flight that we missed due to bad weather. When I get to Miami I had about an hour to get everything done but with the lack of education and common sense from the staff members at American Airlines I was cut short on time. First off in my previous flight I was given a standby ticket for this flight because we were not going to make it to our original flight. When I get to Miami and tried explaining that to the staff member in bag check in she told me ""keep your mouth shut and give me your ticket"". She then tells me I'm too late to check in my bags so I decide not to go with bags. The women gave me back my stand by ticket instead of boarding pass which did not allow me to go to TSA. I then had to go back in the line to get a boarding pass. Finally got a boarding pass and TSA were excellent and let us go ahead of everyone so we could make the flight. When I get to the gate the ""manager"" told me I was not able to get on board because the doors were closed. It was 8.20 and the flight got delayed to 8.40. If I'm not mistaken you can board up to 10 minutes prior to flying. She refused to let us on and decided that her best customer service skill was to scream at us. An elderly disabled women caused a scene at the gate, and she was allowed to board.

American Airlines,1,Paul Renshaw,6th January 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | I bought my ticket via British Airways and 2 of the 5 sectors were with American Airlines. I had thought since I'd bought a full service ticket all the flights would be with full service airlines and not mixed with a budget airline. I am writing to BA to complain - even though the 3 sectors flying with BA were wonderful. My first flight with AA was Las Vegas to London via Chicago. I had no money on me and my cards were in my hand luggage as I didn't think they were needed. These were put in the hold anyway as there was no space in the lockers, but I did not know AA was a budget airline and the whole ""money, money, money is everything"". I got a ""free"" glass of water and went hungry. I then had a tight connection at ORD so had to get straight to the next gate (it said free soft drink is back with much fanfare, so yes, they must have tried to remove even that). I was pleased to see a new aircraft, but it ended there. The staff were such a mixed bunch, never seen a flight crew like it, it was almost as if they were volunteers. Anyway, they were nice enough, a million miles from a full service airline but reckon they gave all they could with their working conditions. Anyway my whole reason for writing this review is because of the food. Now I could feel the resentment from American Airlines. How dare they have to give free food out. What a shame so much of the transatlantic competitors do. I say free, of course it's in the ticket price but they call it complimentary. So by this point I'm starving and my kosher meal came. It blew my mind. One stale bun, crumbled in my hands. No butter or even spread, you'll have it dry. A side of sour shredded veg. I don't know, it was like coleslaw with no mayo and sat in vinegar for days on end until it wilted. Must have been the cheapest thing the catering firm had, it was beyond vile. Simply not edible. The teeny ""main"" was beyond it as well, little drops of pasta that were so overcooked it liquefied upon contact with tongue and tasted of nothing. Just unbelievable. The BBQ ""chicken"" was highly processed, bland and a perfect partner for the horror of it all. Maybe 5,000 flights, this was the most pathetic assortment of rubbish I'd ever been given. Then there was a tiny square of sponge with jam and coconut. I can't eat coconut but hey, the whole thing was vile. For ""breakfast"" the offering was so ridiculous I kindly asked the attendant to take it back. I had hoped for a full English, but thought I might get a warmed 7 day croissant, but no, it was a stale bun with no butter. The mainstream offering was a bag of dried cranberries which I can't eat, a mixed berry slice of muffin (don't expect a full muffin!). It doesn't sound so horrific, just cheap, but I can't eat dried fruit. I did eat the yogurt which American couldn't mess up. I left the first plane ravenous and the second chewing my knuckles. There were only two drinks served over the 7 hours of course. Paid a full service price and fobbed me off with this. They need to disassociate with that brand immediately.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LAS to LHR via ORD,Jan-17,2,2,1,2,2,1,no
American Airlines,1,G Mears,5th January 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Tampa to San Francisco via Phoenix. Hands down the worst airline experience I have ever had. Almost every agent, flight attendant, and other airline staff were inefficient, disgruntled, or rude. I would never recommend this airline. On flight out we had a super old plane that was making all kinds of weird/loud noises. We were on the same plane out of Phoenix and they wouldn't take off with the noise so we returned to the gate and sat for over an hour and a half with no information on what was wrong (just the repeated ""technical issue"" update at about 15 mins intervals and no cabin service). The plane was completely powered off at one point which meant no lights/air for a period of time. When we finally made it to Tampa the power also went off as we were trying to de-board. Fast forward to the return flight and after waiting in a super long line, the curbside check-in didn't work and they wouldn't tell us why. Had to wait in another line to check our stroller inside and the agent there was convinced we were traveling to San Francisco, Costa Rica, not CA. Printed off boarding passes for Tampa and Phoenix in a horrible jumble which we were forced to sort ourselves at security with (at this point) screaming children in tow. Barely made the flight and we were at the airport almost 2 hours in advance. In Phoenix we discovered for some reason our boarding passes no longer had priority on them but group two. I had to wait at the counter for at least 15 mins (children now screaming again) while the agent completely ignored me, and when I was finally able to ask if we could board with priority as we had on every other leg I was very rudely interrupted as the agent said repeatedly, ""what's written on your boarding pass, what's written on your boarding pass?"" We were in the back of the plane that leg - with a four-year old and two-year old. Boarding in group 2 was an absolute nightmare and we held up a bunch of other people. We are also (or I should say were as of today) platinum card holders, but because my father booked the trip for us that didn't matter. At least the plane was newer on that leg, but super bare-bones for the age. Couldn't get the in-flight streaming option to work either (they only support for a limited number of browsers). I have never felt compelled to write an airline review before, but given this experience I felt compelled to warn future travelers (especially those with young children) that this is not the airline for you.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,TPA to SFO via PHX,Jan-17,1,1,1,1,1,1,no

We departed on time and about 3.5 hours into a 5 hour flight the pilot announced that American Airlines had made a decision not to land in Vail do to a winter snow storm. Our plane was completely full of people heading for a ski trip. The incredible decision by AA to head back to Miami was crazy. No chance to deviate to Dallas or even Denver that was open. The entire plane was extremely upset on the poor choice and way of communication, with no regards for the huge investment on our vacation. Upon arrival back in Miami the entire plane, about several 100 people weren't assisted in any way by AA. After waiting almost an hour, they advised us to head to gate D37 a rebooking center, a nightmare of several hours that did not help. We ended up on a flight out of Miami to Charllotte that evening to head into Denver the next morning. We lost that night stay at our hotel in Vail, our lift ticket the following day and ski rental.

American Airlines,1,Robert Mcshane,29th December 2016,Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Orlando to Los Angeles. Utterly disappointed in American Airlines service. First the website told us all seats were taken except additional cost seats at $90. They made us check in at airport and stand in a long line of surly employees to be told that there were actually many available seats at no additional cost. Duplicitous and inconvenient. Next we were told no overheard space for carry ons was left and had to check our carry ons and pick them up at baggage claim. Also ridiculous. AA knows exactly how many people and bags they have - they only run out of space by letting people fill overhead bins with jackets etc. Irresponsible. I would try hard never to fly with these unhappy employees nor this third rate airline. On a humanistic note: there was a Spanish speaking woman in line next to us who was repeatedly dismissed and sent to the back of the line because no one would bother to call one of the many bilingual employees to assist her.

American Airlines,1,M Livingston,28th December 2016,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Miami to Philadelphia. Horrible customer service. After already checking in and going through security, I switched to an earlier flight and was assured by a really nice guy on phone that my bag could be transferred, all I needed to do was speak to an agent here at the airport. Only problem is there wasn't a single agent at any of the desks, including customer service. I finally found an agent behind the Cuba desk and she told me I couldn't switch baggage in domestic flights. So I booked a reservation, paid a fee under the impression by baggage could arrive with me because of contradictory beliefs on a basic, fundamental policy, which should have been explained before I booked my new flight. I called customer service and they said they would not refund me the baggage fee for the inconvenience of coming back to the airport at 1AM to pick up my luggage. She told me to find a different agent and see what could be done. When I found another agent she was on the phone speaking to a friend in Spanish and popping her gum, ignored me for three minutes, then told me to have a seat and be patient for the agent who will arrive in 30 minutes. Outrageously inappropriate. Awful experience. Spent nearly two hours on the phone trying to get answers and running around the airport.

American Airlines,1,M Lander,27th December 2016,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Before I tell you about my experience, let me preface this by stating, 2 weeks ago, my parents had to spend the night in the terminal at Dallas/Fort Worth. Mind you, my father is not the most patient man the earth has ever seen. It took them more than 24 hours to get from Southern Nebraska to San Antonio. That's ridiculous. First, their plane was late arriving at the airport so they could get on it in the first place. Then their flight from DFW to SAT was cancelled, but the airline staff did not announce that, instead they kept leading everyone on as if the plane would be ready at any minute. Their plane, finally ""ready"" at 0700 the next morning, was fully loaded and ready for take off. Until the crew discovered the brakes weren't working. Back to the gate and off the plane they go. My parents finally arrived in San Antonio that night at 2100 (9pm). When it came time for me to go to Texas for Christmas, one week after the aforementioned fiasco, my experience was better, but then again one cannot fall out of a basement.",,Solo Leisure,First Class,SAT to DFW,Dec-16,2,1,1,,1,1,no

Due to head winds the flight was slightly delayed and missed connecting flight to BKK - head winds which are normal this time of year. Now if I know that why didn't the so-called professionals at AA know it? If they had asked me I could have told them the time allowed was insufficient anytime of year. There was no AA staff on the ground, only contract airport staff that had limited interest in passenger / customer satisfaction so the process took hours and with little or no regard for customer concerns or comfort. AA does not know when to quit abusing its customers - meaningless and cynical frequent flyers programs and now they ask you to buy miles when you check in - miles you used to be earning!

I was concerned because I knew the BA Club World Cabin and knew what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. Airlines business cabin is far superior to BA. There is far more room in the seat for storage and shelf space as well as small pockets to stow a mobile whilst charging. The seat is far more private and the kit bag is much better too. I was on a seat near the galley, which was a little noisy so don't reserve a seat too close to the galley on a night flight. I'd had dinner so went straight to sleep.

So instead, American Airlines assigned me a new route which required me to stop in Dallas and then onto San Antonio. The plane was not ready for flight so we had to wait another 2hrs. This is not my worst experience with flying but still, it's the fact of the matter. If I showed up late to my flight, canceled, or had to switch, American Airlines would charge me for that mistake.

American Airlines,1,Sarah Hakola,18th December 2016,"New York JFK to AkronÃ¢â‚¬â€œCanton via Charlotte. Over the past two months I have been traveling through Europe and taken countless flights, but this was by far the worst experience I have ever had. To begin with, the boarding procedure was delayed because the previous flight arrived late. After getting the plane ready the crew boarded us about 30 minutes after our original boarding time. Everyone got on the aircraft and sat and waited for a long time before being told they were experiencing mechanical issues and they were bringing people in to check out the situation. We sat and waited and then were finally told that if we would like to get off the plane we were welcome to. I proceeded to leave the plane to speak with an agent because I knew that I was going to miss my connecting flight in CLT. There was one travel agent available for a whole airplane of people and she seemed to care less about helping us because her shift was supposed to be ending. I asked if I could change my end destination to a larger airport that was within 300 miles of my original end point and I was told no. The only option they could give me was a flight out the next day. I took the new flight information and proceeded to call the service number where I was told the exact opposite information that the travel agent at the airport told me. However, there is nothing that the agents over the phone can do because they cannot physically give you a new boarding pass or vouchers to make up for the inconvenience. By the time I was about to get back in line to speak with the travel agent in person and inform her of what I was told on the phone, there was a line of about 20 people. I went back to the gate and was told to re-board the plane if we had new boarding passes and had been situated on a new flight out of CLT. I got back on the plane and sat for all of five minutes to be told that their flight crew had timed out and a new crew would not arrive for at least another hour. We once again had to exit the plane and go sit by the gate. They did provide us some snacks while we waited and the crew did not arrive until 2 hours later. There was still only one travel agent available to assist passengers who needed to re-book their flights and the customer support agents were impatient, rude, and acted as though this was our problem and not their own. I do not remember hearing the words ""I am sorry for the inconvenience"" once out of anybody. After sitting until 1:00am they finally had a crew and boarded us for a third time on the plane. It took forever to take off and we landed in CLT at about 3:30am. We were told we would receive hotel vouchers, transportation, and food once in CLT. Clearly JFK did not communicate the issues to CLT because the members in Charlotte had no idea what was going on and we had to wait another hour for a supervisor to come out and speak to us. At this point, there was no point in getting a hotel voucher because flights would be leaving within a few hours. I finally spoke with an agent who put me on an earlier flight to a different airport that was close to my original destination. He also provided me with a food voucher. This was the first time that I received answers and was helped in a caring and apologetic way. This was also the first time that I was not quickly shut down and told no. I finally made it home after many hours, many tears, and lots of frustration. The lack of support and concern for their passengers is ridiculous and I will never fly AA again.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,JFK to CAK via CLT,Dec-16,3,3,1,,1,1,no

American Airlines,9,Alan Wan,13th December 2016,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | I was flying MIA to LHR via JFK with American Airlines. This review is for the MIA-JFK route. I was originally booked onto a 757, international configuration with angled lie flat seats. However I took the opportunity to do a same day flight change and get an earlier flight, this would enable me to do a quick bit of shopping. Additionally the change of flight allowed me to sample a reconfigured 767, with the lie flat seats. I arrived at MIA at 6.45am for my 9.26am departure. There was no queue for the Priority check-in and I just needed to pick up my boarding passes as I was hand bag only. The check-in associate was friendly and helpful. I had access to fast track security and I was through in 5 minutes. I used the Admirals Club at Gate 30. It was a pretty pathetic offering, unlike the AA First class lounge at JFK which is excellent. The AC had a very limited free breakfast offering and I had a bagel and coffee. I was provided with a single drinks voucher which I used to get a bottle of water for the flight. Boarding commenced on time at precisely 8.56am - 30 minutes before departure. After people with access needs boarded, First class passengers were invited to board. On boarding a FA offered to hang my coat and I was offered a pre departure drink and I selected coffee. On international legs, a Samsung tablet is provided, but only main screen entertainment was offered on this short 2.5 hour flight. I was provided with in ear headphones. The seat was excellent, fully flat with plenty of space. I was seated in 6D, I would have preferred a window but none where available at checkin. I would have been happy with this seat on an international sector, so felt spoilt for a short domestic flight. The FA who looked after me was great, friendly, attentive and address me by my name. Cereal or a three cheese omelette were on offer. I chose the latter which was definitely the most popular choice. The omelette and the sausage provided were not great, but the side veggies and biscuit were excellent. After eating I promptly fell asleep for the remainder of the flight. Overall besides the poor lounge offering, this was an excellent domestic flight.",Boeing 767,Solo Leisure,Business Class,MIA to JFK,Dec-16,5,5,4,3,4,5,yes

There were seatback televisions with on demand video, not a surmountable amount of options, wifi worked perfectly and I was able to get lots of work done. The flight attendants were sweet and caring.

The service on the return flight from JFK to Tucson in Economy Preferred seating was non existent. Monday 8:00 PM departure on November 22nd from JFK to Tucson, immediate announcement from the cockpit that we could expect air turbulence and the seat belt sign would remain on the entire flight. We encountered three or four slight bumps mid flight, that was it totally smooth flying. Since the seat belt sign was pre determined to stay on it gave the entire plane, except first class no cabin service on the five plus hour flight. The other major uncomfortable problem was the cabin temperature was around 80 degrees and yet there was no one to ask about getting air turned down. No one approached any of the passengers on this five plus hour flight. I arrived Tucson soaked with sweat and dehydrated from no fluid. The first thing I did the next day was cancel the future flights I had booked on American. I realize the airline is working hard to make a comeback, they still have a lot of problems and created a very unpleasant flight back from a long weekend in NYC.

Inflight staff and staff in both airports were extremely rude and snobby, always looking down on you. Generally quite unprofessional. The staff on our flight told us not to call a flight attendant for beverages, instead we were supposed to go to the back of the plane and request them (unheard of on a long haul) .I told them this was ridiculous and that I would do no such thing as that would involve waking up a fellow passenger sleeping next to us on a aisle seat. We were delayed by 2 hours due to a technical issue and there was no update from the captain on whether or not we would make up the time. Check in and airport staff in JFK need to learn some customer service skills. No smiling, rude people that generally look fed up in life and with their job. They sigh, they roll their eyes.

Impossible to sleep or even rest. Most of the business class crew were too busy working to provide service. Los Angeles to Dallas Ft Worth was a disaster. Originally scheduled in First Class on a Boeing 787, changed equipment to A321. Bumped from first class to a middle seat in economy with minimal compensation ($300 future flight credit) and no explanation or apology or even an understanding of why we were irritated.

We were also never told how it was decided which of the first class passengers were bumped. When I asked I was ignored.

I wish I could say that ""I will never fly on American Airlines again"" like some reviewers, but the truth is, with mergers and consolidation it is difficult to do this. This was a trip to Peru, with the flights split between American and LATAM airlines. Three legs of the trip were on American and three on LATAM. The comparison was not good for American. First of all, of the three legs, two of the planes had mechanical issues which led in one case to have to switch planes and the other to sit on the tarmac for an hour. The longest flight was from Miami to Lima on a 767. It looked and felt old and worn out. The seats were pure punishment. They were not the new ""slim line"" seats, but were worn to the point of being hard. The legroom was poor, and I'm only 5'6"". I can't imaging what a six foot tall person had to endure. There was no in seat entertainment, just the drop down screens in various locations. We had a chance to alter our trip plans, and it would have been convenient to change our return trip to leave from Cusco instead of Juliaca. All other legs of the trip would be the same. American could do it for an increase of $7,500! They said the flights were full, and we would have to fly business class.

I did not really fly their ""Premium Economy"" but I count the ""Main Cabin Extra"" to be that because it is still economy class seats with few premium perks. I got bumped to MCE for free at the gate upon request, and it was super comfortable, best part it was the emergency exit row, I was able to sleep well and it is seldom that I sleep on flights.

Compared to my previous bad experiences with AA this one seemed better. The cabin crew were friendly, the flight departed on time, the seat was comfortable but the legroom was bad. Short flight across to Miami from Cayman, got biscoff and drinks, which was fair enough.

After living 8-years overseas in Europe and Latin America, it is such a terrible shock coming back to the ""joy"" of US flagship airlines. Realistically, there aren't any that compare to most serious international carriers. In the US, we have come to accept incredibly poor service as adequate. That said, American seems to find new and creative ways to disappoint and underperform. Whether it is customer service, aircraft maintenance, or just about any other aspect. They just cannot seem to get it right. Do they try to be this bad?

This was a full flight and they were asking passengers from groups 3 and 4 to check their bags. That overhead bins were full and all luggage of groups 3 and 4 must be checked. As group 2 I expected to be fine but had my luggage taken away from me at the gate. As I proceeded to board I saw that there was plenty of overhead space for my luggage which was now checked. My designated seat bin was completely empty and I am very unhappy with being forced to check my bag when there was still room for it.

We chose the flight as it arrived in O'hare the earliest and suited our itinerary - bad choice. Equipment was a very dated 767-300. Tired, dated cabin, no back of seat Avod entertainment, overhead video screens - no choice you either watch the rubbish on that, read or watch your iPad - no wireless either so you can't utilise inflight Gogo even if you did no inseat power. Even the staff know the plane is dated. Breakfast awful and some 4 hrs into the flight still no further trolley service - in fact only saw staff was when the fasten seat belt light came on and they had to check seat belts were fastened. This continued with a portion of ice cream and glass of water at 4 hrs into flight. No drinks service, no further food, no snacks until 7.5 hrs into the flight when you are served or I should say passed a Monty's hot box that purports to be grilled cheese and danish - but is in fact inedible. Longest 9 hrs of my life even flying Transatlantic on a 757 with United had more choice and better service and that's saying something.

Both flights were former US services. Planes have been redesigned with AA colors, but had the original US seat plan (no main cabin extra) and staff was wearing US uniforms. Self service kiosks and bag drop fast, hassle free and agents were reasonably friendly. Also, TSA quite fast and efficient, which was a surprise for ORD. Boarding at both ORD and PHX orderly and efficient. Service on board both flights professional and friendly, with the FAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s regularly present in the cabin. Uniforms of the FAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s were on the Ã¢â‚¬Å“relaxedÃ¢â‚¬Â side on both legs. Plane (A321) on the ORD-PHX leg modern and packed, but seats were comfortable for Economy and leg room excellent due to exit row seat. One beverage service and one water run on this 3+ hour flight. As per usual alcohol and snacks for sale, but items on sale did not look appealing and rather overpriced. No IFE available, but not an issue for this flight duration. Communication from flight deck was kept to the absolute minimum and was not particularly friendly. Early arrival into PHX. Nothing extraordinary or great, but happy to say this was an overall pleasant experience for Economy. Short PHX-LAS hop in First with beverage service only, due to the short duration of the flight and adequate. Initial announcement from the captain was made from the front of cabin, which was a nice gesture. This A320 was clearly an older plane, but seemed well maintained and clean. On time arrival in LAS. Waiting time for bags reasonable and priority bags were out first. Overall, flights were pleasant without being anything special, but definitely one of the better experiences I had on domestic flights in the U.S. recently.

American Airlines,1,Wayne Smith,5th October 2016,"Chicago to Manchester with American Airlines. Worst flight ever. Route was and is advertised with personal entertainment system choice of movies etc. Plane advertised as 787. Instead what we got was a 30 year old 767 that still had its original interior. 6 screens on the centre ceiling that you needed binoculars to see. The seats were very uncomfortable as they were the same age as the aircraft. I asked the staff if the plane was a joke, he said it was a last resort plane as they had technical issues with the Dreamliner, which I since found out was untrue. According to AA customer service the flight was changed several weeks earlier and is still being used to date as they said in their words ""we used this aircraft because it was more profitable"". The fact that it is advertised with all the mod cons did not concern them at all. The magazine in the seat pocket was all stuck together and some of them were totally in Spanish. The movie was a Disney movie and the people who made the outbound journey on this flight said the movie was in Spanish and could not be changed. The flight was unable to carry any duty free items as they didn't have anywhere to store it. AA customer service offered us a voucher for $100 off our next flight but like I told them ""Why would we ever fly with them again on a 30 year old aircraft when there are far superior carriers out there that actually give you what you pay for?""

American Airlines,1,Jacob Bracher,2nd October 2016,"If you are flying somewhere with connecting flights, this is not the airline for you. I paid $525 dollars to get from Gainesville, Florida to Maruqette, Michigan. I got delayed in Charlotte two times to Chicago and then both flights got cancelled. I ended up getting to Chicago past midnight where I had to sit in the airport until 3 AM where I asked to speak to a supervisor. It took her over ten minutes to come in which she proceeded to stand over in a corner and stare at everyone until one of the customer service representatives had to go remind her that I was waiting for her. When she comes over and I tell her what's going on, she denies me assistance because ""she can only help me if one of the customer assistance ladies can't help me."" Then she rudely told me, ""I'm going to direct you to the line behind you to speak to a customer representative."" After walking into the line and waiting I was speaking to the lady about rebooking my flight to Marquette. Marquette was full that day and I would have been number 13 on standby. So my options were either take a plane to Greenbay (which is 3 hours from Marquette) or wait another 36 hours in an airport to fly to Marquette. Obviously my hands were tied and I chose to go to Greenbay. I was put on standby for an 8:40 AM flight and confirmed on a flight at noon. I sat in the airport until 8 and by this point I had been up over 24 hours. The flight at 8:40 was a bit delayed, and I waited until almost everyone boarded before approaching the boarding assistant and asking them if there were any seats available for people on standby. She asked for my name, I gave it to her, and she told me I wasn't on the standby list. I showed her my ticket proving I was and she denied still that I was on the standby list. She then proceeded to ignore me for a few minutes before closing the flight, telling me she can't help me, and walked away. I needed to get on that flight because I had no way of getting from Marquette to Greenbay except for a friend who could pick me up if I had gotten on the earlier flight. I end up going up to some other people who worked at American Airlines and asked for a supervisor. They asked what the problem was and I told them. They kept telling me I wasn't on the standby list and there was nothing they could do. They ended up telling me to ""go away because there's nothing they can do to help me."" When I finally got to speak to a supervisor, she told me I ended up getting confirmed on the 8:40 flight and there was no way for me to know. This means that their worker neglected to check if I was confirmed and forced me to miss my flight for no reason other than pure laziness. When I finally get to Greenbay, I ask the supervisor there to get me to Marquette somehow. He just shrugged and told me ""he can't help me because I said it was okay for them to get me to Greenbay."" My hands were tied, I had no choice. I ended up having to rend a car for $200 and driving 3 hours sleep deprived to finally get to my destination. So while I had to pay $525 for my ticket, I ended up having to pay a total of $725 just to get to my destination. This airline does not care about their customers and will do as least as possible for you. I spoke to four different supervisors at three different airports and only one was kind and tried to help me.

The cabin crew were barely polite and you knew they were just going through the motions doing the bare minimum that they had to. After the plane began taxiing the Captain reported that there was a fault with the flaps and would have to return to base where we had to sit on the plane for 2 hours (during which the crew came round with water for the passengers) while they determined that it was an instrument problem and not a physical problem with the flaps so after 3.5 hours delay we managed to take off. As stated before the staff were not exactly rude, just not pleasant and did the bare minimum they had to. The inflight entertainment is non-existant as neither the 737 outbound or the 757 inbound have seat back screens, just the aisle screens which give no choices and showed terrible entertainment.

In both directions, YYJ-YYZ legs served by A321s, YYZ-YOW legs by A320s. Seats and legroom comfortable although there was a 5 cm gap between the fuselage and window-seat armrests, reducing seat width unnecessarily. FAs made frequent runs to offer water. Three main glitches, all to be taken in stride as part of air travel nowadays: (i) Outbound from YYJ, the video safety presentation could not be played aloud through the cabin's PA system (though it was on the video screen), so FAs had to demonstrate the safety features themselves. (ii) The onward outbound YYZ-YOW leg was delayed nearly an hour, with all passengers remaining seated, while a possible technical fault in the cockpit controls was investigated. (iii) Accumulation of incoming flights at YOW meant that YOW baggage system was backed up and dispensing of baggage was delayed till an hour after aircraft had arrived. Oddly, on the five-hour return leg YYZ to YYJ, when I purchased a gin-and-tonic the miniature bottle was labelled ""Duty free"" and ""Export strength"" (47.3 percent alcohol). If Air Canada can use duty-free alcohol to serve on domestic flights, their price of CAD 6.50 per drink is pretty steep.

Air Canada,1,Josh Banman,19th February 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Puerto Vallarta to Kelowna via Vancouver. Flight to Puerto Vallarta was good, staff awesome and service was prompt. Unfortunately on the way home I can't say the same. We checked in early and selected our seats to ensure a window and isle seat and to avoid the long lines at the airport waiting for check in. Once we arrived at the airport we waited 3rd in line for over an hour watching everyone who was checking in at the airport go through infront of us due to a computer issue. Then we were told that the flight was full and we had to sit in the middle despite checking in 24 hours before. Once in the plane the AC unit went down and we sat on the runway inside the boiling hot plan for an hour while crews scrambled to fix the issue. So we take off and I'm excited to get water after waiting in a hot plane for an hour only to wait 3 hours into the 5.5 hour flight to even speak to a flight attendant. When I asked why things were so slow they scoffed at me and blamed the airline for cutting down from 7-6 flight attendants for this flight. Now I understand this can be stressful for them and create more work, but where I'm confused is how come on the way down with 6 flight attendants I received awesome service and water and coffee several times? I wish it could stop there but unfortunately it doesn't, we had to catch a connecting flight wich was overbooked, and we were asked if anyone would like to stay behind in Vancouver, only to find out it was so two Air Canada employees could fly home. Once our connecting flight to Kelowna landed at 12am our little plane of 30 had to sit on the runway for an hour while the other 2 international planes of over 150 passengers unloaded. Super disappointed in Air Canada and will definitely choose WestJet when flying next time.

Air Canada,10,Tracey Roberts,19th February 2017,Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | London Heathrow to Calgary. I had a very enjoyable 8 hr flight with Air Canada in economy! Service was excellent. Flight attendants went out of their way to make sure you had plenty of refreshments and plenty of water. In flight entertainment was 1st class showing all the latest films. Seats were comfortable. No delays. I was served a hot meal with drinks of my choice not long after take off and also a hot snack about an hour before landing. Two weeks later on 18th December I flew back to the UK with Air Canada and again excellent service.

Air Canada,3,K Mitchell,18th February 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | London Heathrow to Newark via Toronto with Air Canada. I chose this airline as I am a Star Alliance Gold member but this was clearly a big mistake. This is the first time I have seen ten seats per row in economy on a B777 and I have flown many airlines. The seats were so narrow the it reminded me of a very low budget airline. Seven hours on a seat like this and you come out with leg and back pain. I had to keep my hands stack on my body as there was no space to rest them. Do not bother paying for the extra legroom seats as these are even more narrow due to the entertainment monitor stored in the armrest. Flight attendants completely uninterested and rude. No response to seat calls. Priority delivery of luggage for gold members not respected at Newark - our luggage came out among the last. Out of the four flights, three were late by an hour without any explanation of apology. Meals during flights small and of average quality.

Air Canada,1,B Rayner,13th February 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Montreal to St Louis via Toronto. I am trilingual Canadian frequent flyer 35K with Air Canada (I speak English 1st language, French 2nd language and Spanish 3rd language). I am always courteous, respectful of other cultures and speak the language of the person with whom I am doing business if I can. Air Canada is Canada's national airline (and I believe was even built with some public funding) and is expected to be bilingual English and French. When I travel to Montreal Quebec, quite often the attendants do not show this same courtesy of speaking English to me even when I clearly state this preference as a client. When I fly to other Canadian (outside of Quebec) or American cities they speak the language of your choice. I have flown many airlines over the past few years from many differant countries and more and more I am disappointed by Air Canada for the reasons described above, not to mention pricing and services offered.

Air Canada,5,M Lawson,9th February 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | I have travelled extensively over the years with many different airlines and, unfortunately, I have to say, I found on my recent flights Sydney to Vancouver return, the service on Air Canada is amongst the slackest I have experienced. On the way back from Vancouver, I had a head cold and needed regular drinks. I buzzed several times for tea / water etc but only once was my request answered. For the rest of the 16 hour journey, I buzzed but to no avail. Each time I needed a drink, or food, I had to get up from my seat, crawl over my fellow passengers, walk to the end of the aircraft to get my own refreshment. The worst part was, the entire crew was having a lovely time sitting down at the back, chatting away to each ignoring passenger requests. When I asked if they had noticed my bell call, they said they didn't hear it. However, when they looked, there were 3 others needing assistance listed on the screen. I wouldn't have heard the bell either if I was in the middle of a conversation. In addition to the lack of service, I feel that there could have been more food offered (it was minimal on such a long flight) and at no stage did the drinks trolley go around. Up to each passenger to request a drink. I guess it's a money saving ploy. The inflight entertainment was limited to a dozen movies that have been out for some time and didn't cater to a range of tastes. On 2 x 16 hour flights, this meant the choice was very limiting so I resorted to reading my book. Also, no wifi. Now that Air Canada has some competition from Sydney to Vancouver, it may be worth the crew lifting their game to remain competitive. On a positive note, the flight crew did a marvellous job getting us from A to B on both flights. Just a pity the cabin crew let the airline down.

Nice and big aircraft. Seats compare to other air lines (LH, KLM, Delta) are very small and uncomfortable. The food that was served was one of the lousiest. The cabin staff seem trained not to greet the passenger and not smile while serving. Food served first, drinks served 30 mins after the food. Stupid way to serve for a such a long flight, the aircraft was not equipped with WiFi. Washrooms were unhygienic and after first 5 - 6 hours, no staff was keeping the washrooms clean.

The business class product on both flights YUL-YYC and YYC-NRT was dated, old, but the FA made it feel great.

AC is not cheap compared to flying United, EVA, ANA or even Lufthansa is most cases but the company has modified their cabin configuration to the mighty 3x4x3 on a B77L that is not built for such capacity especially when it is meant to do utlra long haul flights.

Air Canada,2,L Hanmer,21st January 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Shanghai to Toronto, I had a cascade of events which started on the tarmac and in the air which embarrassed the crew.

The first attendant rebooted the entertainment system and though I could not use the hand set, I was able to use the touch screen. I like to listed to classical music but there was no Mozart, no classical. A drink was served on my tray which collapsed. Now I am soaked with a double scotch. I have an extra shirt in my carry on and go to Business class bathroom where the sink was broken and wrapped in wide, colored adhesive tape. But its fine, when things go wrong, the flight attendant gives you a plastic Maple leaf pin right from his lapel. And documents the whole thing and submits it while we are in the air. I really did appreciate that. A month later I received an the email which was a voucher to use when you book a flight with us.

Was downgraded to Economy from Premium Economy the next day even though Business seats were available. Could not upgrade to Business Class with money because had no aero club membership. No one in the call centre could do the upgrade because there was no manager, which seems to be the title for the only staff who can make decisions. Told that we were lucky to be on the flight at all. They forgot to rebook our son on the next leg to Calgary and so had to take a later flight with 5 hour layup instead of 1.5 hours.

Air Canada,2,Gabrielle Wang,10th January 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Brisbane to Vancouver. I flew Air Canada Business Class flight AC36 from Brisbane to Edmonton via Vancouver to visit my in-laws as I do every year during Christmas. I am impressed with their new aircraft. The business class seats were comfortable, food was not spectacular however I was happy with it. There was only one washroom dedicated for business class, it was very small and not clean. There were two other washrooms that were shared with premium economy class. Overall, I was not very impressed with the washrooms arrangements. The cabin crew were helpful but not the best. The overall inflight experience was a positive one. Despite the food being so-so, and I was not impressed with the washrooms, I had a restful and comfortable flight. My experience went downhill when I couldn't find my luggage at the airport. Later that day, Air Canada confirmed that my luggage was left at Brisbane Airport. I was waiting on the phone for one solid hour until I reached an operator who told me the best they can do is $50 per day compensation before the luggage arrive. I tried to explain to her that with the freezing cold winter in Edmonton, I could not possibly buy anything warm enough with $50. However, she could not do anything else and Air Canada does not have a customer service phone line. My luggage arrived 2 days later at my in-laws house. By then, I was in Orlando for a 6 days trip in which I had to purchase 6 days worth of essential items in Orlando. Anyhow, I eventually got my luggage when I returned to Edmonton, however, I never received the compensation Air Canada promised. I tried to reach them with their phone line only to be told that I had to write them a ""letter"". I called Brisbane Airport and was given the manager's number. I called the manager and was told that this was a secure number and that the airport should have never given this number to me and hung up. I have sent Air Canada an email and a Facebook message.

Air Canada,4,T Eldem,10th January 2017,Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Munich to Toronto with Air Canada. We were met by the AC Concierge and promptly processed through the check-in formalities. The flight was delayed by a full hour due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft. On board the high density configuration in Economy (3x4x3) on the B777 is simply awful. I had the bulkhead aisle seat and my knee and elbow were bumped several times and my foot stepped on twice. I cannot imagine anyone getting any sleep in that seat during an overnight flight. The configuration makes the aisles so narrow that one has to walk sideways so as not to bump into other passengers. This is a sad reminder that AC puts profits way ahead of passenger comfort. The FA's were all very nice and worked hard throughout the flight. The in flight service director on the other hand was smug and very condescending. Food was OK for Economy but portions were very small. IFE was descent but music selection remains obscure.

Air Canada,4,M Norton,1st January 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | What has happened to our beautiful Airline? We always flew Air Canada for the service and the people but now I fly further to avoid Air Canada. On Dec 31 2016, AC873, FRA-YYZ, either the FA who worked the rear business class section was getting ready for retirement or she was having a really bad day because her unfriendly, take it or leave it, monosyllabic attitude was quite pronounced. The new business class seat on the 777-300 is actually not so bad. The screen's a bit close but it's big and the seat depth is a bit short (I could never get the foot rest up to a comfortable height) but there's lots of space and charging stations and places for things. Very mediocre wine selection, I think one choice of either old or new world in red or white and as I said very mediocre. I hear they have espresso's and cappuccino's but they were not offered. I ordered the vegetarian meal which came out vegan and really it's mind boggling what the kitchen at AC thinks vegetarians eat. Years ago I had an amazing veg meal on a flight from Toronto to Calgary, roasted veg with baked tofu, really well done but this was some tasteless roasted eggplant on Polenta with a tablespoon of tomato sauce and that's pretty much what AC serve these days. All of this would have been overlooked if the FA had shown any kind of welcome or pleasant attitude. It was bare minimum, no more and definitely no service with a smile. AC 610, YYZ-YHZ started out well and I slept through most of it until the last 15 minutes of landing approach, when a little boy two rows behind us in business class, started to piercingly scream for his mother and was unconsolable screaming ""Momee"" until we landed. I thought maybe mommy was meeting the plane but it turned out that ""Momee!"" was the FA in-charge. To her credit, she remained the FA in-charge and didn't get up but probably not a good idea to fly with the family. I was a loyal AC flyer for decades but now Lufthansa and United I like better and I fly them 90% of the time. The timing on this route was deciding factor in flying with AC this time but that will not happen again. LH FA's are always welcoming and friendly and cannot do enough to make you comfortable up front. Other airlines amenity kits are becoming collectables but not so the hideous herringbone, sparse offering on AC. LH, Eva and Thai's Rimova amenity kits are a reason to fly them and not available anywhere else. I think AC have forgotten that many of us love to fly and it's about a happy experience. They are making money again and lots of it but at the expense of the customer service experience.

Air Canada,4,Sid Grover,29th December 2016,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Delhi to Toronto. Although Air Canada had a newer plane, the Boeing 787, it lacked in service. Executive pod seats are very comfortable. Fully flat bad recline. Lots of place to store things like phone, wallet. Food tasted fresh and had decent flavours. One of the washrooms wasn't working - the one in the front right by the cockpit. This is not a big deal for a 7 hr flight but a 15 hrs flight it is. As a result we had access to two washrooms behind the cabin - still not bad. Air Canada did a horrible job in terms of controlling who can access which washroom. Folks from premium economy and economy were using the business washrooms. I mean I paid extra for a reason. Every time I had to visit the washroom - there was a line up. My wife was sleeping and didn't hear the announcement that the front washroom is not working - when she went to the front, one of the staff members rudely said, ""we told you it's not working"" My wife apologized and came back. Service - Before take off the staff brought drinks like champagne and orange juice, and my wife asked for a ginger ale. Staff initially brought sprite by mistake and then forgot about it. When my wife asked for ginger ale again she was told we cannot serve on ground. Initially we were not given the menu. When I complained they brought it. And then they took away my wife's food menu by mistake. Every time she asked for a menu - staff did a horrible job explaining what's available instead of giving a menu. In the morning she asked for omelette and was still given crepes. Everyone else was given 3 choices for breakfast. But some like myself were given 2. This is how inconsistent the service was.

Air Canada,1,Richard Ferris,26th December 2016,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Recently, my wife and I were flying from Rochester to Cairo by way of Toronto and London Heathrow. My wife and I were originally told at the gate in Toronto that the flight from Toronto to London was delayed 15 minutes, then it became 30 minutes. Then we were told that a new plane had to be brought in because of a mechanical issue and it would be about a 1.5 hour delay. We explained our concern to the agent at the gate, because we only had a 2 hour layover in Heathrow and were worried about missing our connecting flight to Cairo. She said that the plane would ""make up time in the air"". Ultimately, we actually left more than 2 hours later than scheduled because the new plane was also late. This caused us to miss our connecting flight to Cairo. There are several exacerbating factors than just a delay. When we got on the plane, I told the flight attendant that we were going to be rushed to get to our connecting flight and asked if we could be let out first. Her response was ""We'll see"". When we landed, we were not given any accommodation whatsoever. We didn't land until approximately 10:15 p.m. The flight crew said that ""if"" we missed our connecting flight (scheduled to leave at 10:30), we should go upstairs to the ticket office to get re-booked. Apparently, they didn't know, despite servicing that airport, that Heathrow pretty much shuts down at 10pm and so the ticket offices were already deserted by the time we got there and the terminal gates shut down. This left us stranded at the airport, with no instructions or assistance, or any idea what we were supposed to do. We happened to ask a worker at the airport and he said we should check to see if our bags were there. Come to find out, our bags had been taken off the plane and set aside (not on the carousel). No one with Air Canada let us know our bags would be dropped off at Heathrow, rather than go straight to Cairo as originally planned. Obviously, whomever removed the bags knew we wouldn't be able to get on the next flight, even though no one else seemed to. If it hadn't been for the airport employee, we wouldn't have even known our bags were and they would have been inadvertently abandoned. We had to stay at the airport until the ticket office re-opened at 6:30 a.m. Once we got there, the Air Canada employee said a ticket agent would have been waiting outside the plane for us, to provide a hotel room. I'm not sure how we were supposed to know this when we were told conflicting information by the flight crew and the only people we saw waiting at the gate were there to help some disabled travelers in need of assistance. No one had a sign with our name or anything which would allow us to know that steps had been taken to provide us with a place to sleep. As a result of this delay, we lost a full day of a paid tour in Egypt and incurred expenses at the airport for food and beverages, since the next flight wasn't until 2pm that following day. In our complaint to Air Canada, they offered a discount for a future booking and didn't even address reimbursement for our out-of-pocket loss. I've made numerous international flights and this is the first time I've had any substantive issues with an airline.

Unlike the previous two times when I transferred at Toronto Pearson, I now made a stopover at London Heathrow so it was an interline flight with British Airways. I tend to choose for Air Canada on the route between Amsterdam and Ottawa because it is generally cheaper and has a better schedule than the competition. It was a really smooth 7-hour long plane trip, and the airplane used on the London to Ottawa route is the usual Boeing 767-300ER, an old but always reliable workhorse in the medium-sized, long-range plane repertoire. The cabin crew members were nice and worked very efficiently. I use Air Canada often and while the drinks and snacks are good, I have come to refusing the main meal because in economy class they always serve the same two things and they're simply uneatable. I really do believe that Air Canada could come up with better standard economy class meals. The legroom was good enough and there was a good choice of films and shows on the inflight entertainment system.

I asked - politely - if they could be quieter. Didn't work as they came back again, so a sleepless flight. Some FAs rude too. FA selling duty free said 'why don't you read the guide' when I asked about a particular scotch. Inflight entertainment selections poor and touch screen controls unresponsive. Food mediocre at best.

Air Canada,5,K Villeneuve,7th December 2016,"First time flying Air Canada from New York to Montreal and return. Had a wonderful experience on Air Canada Express operated by Sky Regional on the outbound flight. Friendly, efficient ground staff at LGA, very clean, well-maintained aircraft and very friendly flight attendants. Was looking forward to my return with them on Air Canada mainline. Booked a seat in the ""Preferred"" section for extra legroom. The agents at YUL were very friendly but the cabin crew had no smiles to spare, and were surly to boot. They were perfunctory at best, and took zero interest in their jobs. A better experience than American Eagle or Delta Connection on the same route because of the aircraft used, but the mainline Air Canada flight attendants could use some training in customer care and courtesy.",E190,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,YUL to LGA,Dec-16,3,2,3,4,4,3,no
Air Canada,6,Hugo Li,6th December 2016,"Toronto to Hong Kong. Overall, Air Canada provided me with the basics of this long haul trip. The food was good and the portion is definitely enough for a flight. Entertainment was one of the great things I enjoyed on this flight, a very through collection of music, TV, movies etc. Air Canada could loosen up their seating for longer flights because they really have to understand this is their customer's home for the next 12-16 hours. Make the seats wider would be a great improvement instead of trying to use every space possible to squish in passengers. Basics provided and I'm really not that picky about anything else. Cabin crew were very friendly on this long haul flight, they will tend to your needs very continually and doing everything with their given resources to make you have a better flight experience.",Boeing 777-200LR,Family Leisure,Economy Class,YYZ to HKG,Jan-16,2,4,4,4,3,3,no

Cabin crew was not patrolling the cabin when not serving. Press the button to call them and they took 10-12 mins to come to me. The food served is not enough for me, and had to ask them for something to eat. They do not offer alcohol and don't carry it on top of their trollies.

Air Canada,8,M Marshall,26th November 2016,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | First time flying Air Canada to fly from the U.S. to Montreal in the province of Quebec. The flight, in general, was comfortable and did not have any guffaws, save for a bumpy descent (which, I must emphasize, is not in any way the crew's nor the pilots' fault). The plane was only half-full, and we were asked to distribute ourselves in the flight. Cabin service consisted of beverages, no nibbles and on both segments of the flight, the flight attendants asked if we wanted a second round of drinks. No complaints about the short flight and will certainly fly with them again in the future.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,PHL to YUL,Nov-16,4,4,4,,4,4,no

We were surprised to see the plane was only about one half full. I haven't seen that in a while. It made for a very pleasant flight. My wife and I each had a row of seats to spread out in. The Air Canada staff was very good. They were very good about beverage service. The meal however was almost inedible. It was a beautiful day and a portion of the flight was over Greenland. Some great scenery. We were on time and with the open seats we had a great flight. Too bad you can't count on that.,Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to YYZ,Sep-16,4,4,2,2,4,4,no
Air Canada,8,B Johnson,24th November 2016,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | We flew Air Canada from Toronto To London Heathrow on a Boeing 777. The flight left on time, almost midnight. The flight was completely full. We had seats in the back of the plane. Most of the rows of seats are 3 - 4 - 3. In the back some rows are only 2 across. That's what we were assigned. There was a little extra room to the outside seat, but, the seats were pretty cramped, knee room was minimal. The food was not very good. It was a night flight, so we weren't very hungry. The entertainment system was so-so, The movie selection was not very good. A few recent movies and some old TV shows. Even the music selection was minimal. The Air Canada staff was pretty good. They were friendly and helpful, even though the plane was full. They made frequent passes with cold water. All in all it was a pretty good flight. Economy flights are pretty basic, This was about as good as economy gets.",Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Economy Class,YYZ to LHR,Sep-16,2,4,2,2,4,4,no
Air Canada,8,Bobby Giannakopoulos,19th November 2016,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Montreal to New York-LaGuardia. I travel often with Air Canada because it's the airline of my choice and there's always good route options out of Montreal which is one of their main hubs. I chose LaGuardia airport because there's more flights than Newark airport. The flights were operated by Sky Regional their airline partner on short haul legs. I was suppose to take a morning flight however I ended up taking an afternoon flight because I had a Business Class booking on stand by and the morning flights were oversold. My flights were full, gates agents were asking for volunteers to check in some oversize carry on bags. I had a seat on the economy cabin because there were upgrades last minute. The return flight was Business class. All the flights were good. The service was pretzels with a drink in economy class and a light snack with a drink in Business class. The flight attendant was very nice on the inbound flight, taking good care of me and my family during the flight. The flight attendant was fine on the return leg but she was a bit exhausted. Inflight entertainment was very good for a short flight. There was a choice of movies and tv shows on the screens on each seat. I took the same leg a few years ago on American Eagle and the aircraft was smaller no in flying entertainment. The service with Air Canada is much better. I would fly again with this airline without hesitation.",E175,Family Leisure,Business Class,YUL to LGA,Nov-16,4,4,4,4,4,4,yes
Air Canada,10,Stephen Brunette,18th November 2016,"Istanbul to Ottawa via Toronto with Air Canada. TK from Izmir to Istanbul, normal flight, rushed boarding. Air Canada 787 Dreamliner from Istanbul to Toronto. Very strict security in Istanbul for Air Canada, very reassuring. The flight in economy was excellent, aisle seat. Very comfortable seat, I am 5'8"" and had no problem with room, seat between me and the window seat was empty. The flight attendants couldn't have been nicer, great service, after first meal and drink service, water runs every half hour, the flight attendants didn't disappear, and were always available. Mid flight snack and another meal before landing, all acceptable and hot. The size of the windows, humidity levels and fresh air were wonderful, no dryness. An excellent aircraft and product from Air Canada. Flight from Toronto to Ottawa was normal on an A320.

Air Canada,4,Phuong Nguyen,15th November 2016,"Hong Kong to Vancouver. I have flown Air Canada several times both long-haul with the Dreamliner and short-haul within Canada. Biggest complaints: A meal is not served on flights within Canada, even though it's 4-5 hours long and the price is very high. You basically get a small bag of pretzel or a cookie. On the long-haul flights, I dont know why the food on flights to Asia is way better than to Europe. Second thing on the long-haul flights, there are not enough washroom. All flights on the B787 people were constantly lining up in front of the washrooms. I do not think it's worth the money because the amount you pay for your flights in Canada is ridiculously high but you get minimum service.",Boeing 787-9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,HKG to YVR,May-16,3,2,2,3,4,1,yes
Air India,2,Nisha Reddy,10th December 2018,Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | London to Mumbai. Received horrible customer service from Air India. Booked my flight to India on Air India website and our code shared flight from Canada to London was cancelled. Air India kept routing us to different number and they haven't been very helpful. Called Air Canada and they said the flight has been cancelled in July and yet I was able to book this flight on the Air India website. Air Canada is not able to help us because we didn't book the ticket on their website and Air India is not taking any ownership of his situation. We are kind of stuck in the airport and I am travelling with a 6 month old baby. They are not booking us into another flight or they not giving us out refund.

But although the Airport Authority of India did not have any problem with it, Air India restricted me from going out of the New Delhi Airport and quickly forced me to do the Security checking for the next flight. I had chosen this unclean, untimely airline which serves stale food only to use the transit time to meet my friends in Delhi which did not happen due to them. By the way, I'm an Indian citizen myself. So, whereas all the other outside Airports/Airlines allow the transit travelers to go outside in case of time gaps, it's only the problem of Air India.

First, they put me in an international flight, from Delhi to Lucknow. The entire flight was full of men hardly 5 female boarded the plain other than me. I was given a seat in the middle of two creepy men constant trying to tap my hands and legs. The refreshment - 2 butter cookies and a juice carton worth 20 bucks. Disgrace! One good thing they do on domestic flights is at least serve a veg wrap & muffin - especially morning. To further add to my frustration, the porters shared the domestic luggage half an hour later on the belt, where the international luggage was put within the first 5 minutes. Half of the luggage anyway was going back in the connecting flight for the passengers. What a crazy morning!

Flight from Newark airport to Mumbai airport, seats were not comfortable, the screen and the remote was defective. We were literally fighting with the screen to select the movie or pause or play it. The remote few buttons was missing for both of us. Food was not good and bread were hard and cold. The service was also not good. Our connecting flight is from Mumbai to Bangalore. We are still waiting at the airport which forced me to share this review at this moment itself. It seems our connecting flight didn't reach airport.

I am extremely disappointed as a consumer and I know for a fact that I rather pay a lot extra for another flight but I will not be travelling in Air India again.

Air India,8,V Harish,9th October 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Bangalore. I had taken this afternoon flight hoping to arrive in the evening but however as soon as I checked in, I realized that the flight was delayed by over 2 hours and was instead to depart in the evening which was not an ideal situation even though the notification and updates were provided. So I had to kill time at the airport as there was plenty of time on my hands. The flight then took off at the new departure time and the flight was not exactly a full flight and the pushback was on time so the service was on the leisurely side. Dinner was served on this flight due to the delayed departure and during the course of the flight the pilots had kept the passengers updated regarding the course of the flight and the other details which was a good touch because not many pilots tend to do it as much as it should be done. Touchdown was also on time and baggage was swiftly collected from the belts which led to a swift embarkation. Overall, apart from the 2 hours delay which was of no serious consequence, everything else on the flight was standard and uneventful, the crew was engaging and friendly.",A320,Business,Economy Class,Mumbai to Bengaluru,Oct-18,5,5,5,,5,5,yes
Air India,1,B Mueller,25th September 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Delhi to Chicago. This was my first and last trip with this airline. Not only are the staff incompetent, they are not honest. Our flight was initially arranged for a Saturday, they diverted the plane without telling the passengers, and instead communicated with the passengers there were Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtechnical problemsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ which were creating delays. The first lie was a 2 hour delay, the second a 4 hour delay, and on the third 2 hour delay which then established a cumulative 6 hour delay - at least 60 male and female passengers were at the podium at gate 26B in the Delhi airport demanding answers or plans. Air India supervisors, who had no competence, leadership, organization, or plans were found to have lied to the passengers once one of the younger employees admitted they knew all along the flight was not coming. These supervisors engaged in a 3 hour argument with these 60 or so passengers and at the end offered nothing to the passengers at all. I was embarrassed for the employees of the airline and the passengers who were from India - the riotous display the airline was unable to control or relieve tells me they have no concept of current airline practices or any consideration for customer service.",Boeing 777,Business,Business Class,Delhi to Chicago,Sep-18,1,1,1,1,1,1,no

The service and especially the food was very good. I had mutton with rice and my girlfriend took the vegetarian option. Both meals very very good.

Air India,8,C BUlmer,16th September 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Delhi to Bangkok. I found the business class staff to be exceedingly friendly and courteous and professional. Upon landing the Chief Purser came around and shook everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hands, remembering names and thanking us for choosing to fly with Air India. The services were fine, with a choice of alcoholic beverages and pre-dinner snacks. The meal was not too bad, but unlike other airlines, the whole thing, including dessert is served on one crowded tray. The promised choice of desserts and chocolates never appeared. This is not a deal breaker, but just a bit surprising given the number of staff and the limited number of seats in business class. I think where Air India falls down is in its dÃƒÂ©cor. Even though this was a fairly new Boeing 787, it looked tattered and worn. The colors, light tan and sad red, give it a dingy look. Entertainment choices were ok, and the seats were generally pretty comfortable.

Air India,1,J Luemer,29th June 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Frankfurt to Goa via Delhi. My wife and I booked a flight from Munich to Goa via Frankfurt and Delhi in Business Class, then after some days from Goa to Kathmandu via Mumbai and the return from Kathmandu to Munich. The flight from Munich to Frankfurt was operated by Lufthansa, the other flights were operated by Air India. The booking was in one ticket. The flight from Munich to Frankfurt with Lufthansa was nice. When it was time for boarding in Frankfurt, Air India could not open the ticket. After a lengthy discussion we were finally allowed to board the aircraft (without boarding passes), which already had some 45 minutes delay due to our issue. Our seats that we reserved months ago were given to other passengers so we had separate seats. The business class seat actually is okay and so was the onboard service. The seat just looked dirty and used. Air India uses a new 787 on this route but they look like old 767 that have been in service for the past 20 years. After all, we were just too frustrated to enjoy them. Once in Delhi, an agent picked us up and escorted us to the gate for our connecting flight which we boarded without a boarding pass. While the Air India representatives in Frankfurt organized that we arrive at our destination, they did not think about our Air India flight from Goa to Kathmandu. Long story short: The agents in Goa could not find the ticket and we booked a new flight to Mumbai in Economy Class. The agents in Mumbai could see the ticket but since we did not use the portion from Goa to Mumbai the ticket was now invalidÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and we bought another Ticket from Mumbai to Kathmandu. (By now the ticket was refunded and we received a compensation. But that was a long way.) Verdict: I had quite a few other flights with Air India last year and there is always something that does not work. It is part of the adventure of travelling to India I guess, but in the future I will try to avoid Air India. It is just not a good airline.",Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Goa via Delhi,Oct-17,3,3,3,2,1,3,yes
Air India,2,R Saroop,22nd June 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | We flew from Washington Dulles Airport (IAD) to New Delhi, India on non stop Air India flight Number AI 104 in Business Class on April 11, 2018. After taking off from Washington, D.C. lunch was served around 12:30 P.M. After lunch the dinner was served around 9:30 P.M. almost after 9 hours. In these 9 hours there was no food service at all. They did not care to offer even a light snack or a sandwich. for nine hours and this was in the Business Class, we do not know what they did in the Economy Class. When asked the staff about this, we were told that they are suppose to serve only two meals in such a long flight. We can understand you serve two major meals but how about some snacks etc. in nine hours. It would have been fine but since I am a diabetic and need to eat some thing on regular intervals. But sorry that is the only food service they offer. Wanted to talk to the Supervisor about it and was told the supervisor would come to talk to you but of course nobody came to talk to us at all until we landed in New Delhi as if you simply do not care and if you are diabetic then it is your problem. We have flown in Business Class on so many different airlines around the world and have never experienced such a poor food service. Have you ever compared your business class service with other airlines? How can you compete with them with this kind of service? They serve food, drinks and snacks throughout the flight in Business Class without even asking. No wonder Air India is losing money. Who would like to pay this kind of money for Business Class and get this kind of service. It is surprising, at one time Air India was known for it's food service. We were totally dissatisfied.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Washington to New Delhi,Apr-18,2,2,1,1,2,2,no

Then on arrival in Sydney - my luggage was missing. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a direct flight from Delhi to Sydney - how can the luggage go missing? There was a long wait at Sydney airport to for the passengers to lodge the complaint. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two days since I arrived and there is no sign of luggage in cold and wintry Sydney!

Although the airline uses new aircraft's, in my case it was a 787 Dreamliner, and food was good. I found the crew very impolite and the customer service was therefore quite poor, the staff did not share a single smile throughout both flights. Moreover, when I asked a question, I got a very rude ""No"", without any excuse.

IFE at my seat was not working, I was offered another seat with working one (I opted to stay back as I wanted to sleep). Drinks were served with decent options followed by hot food with vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, and breakfast before landing. Only thing which bothered me was absence of smile and courtesy on Cabin crew. I understand the job is quite demanding but a little smile, thank you, please etc. can bring a lot of change. After all, the cabin crew is the face of any airline. Being 6 feet tall I had ample of space to spread my legs.

I have been flying Air India for 4 years regularly but on international flights the staff seem to be getting worse and worse. On a flight which departs at 11 pm they insist on serving drinks from 11.45 to 12.45 in the night. You request the meal with your drink the person serving my section refused saying he will get it after drinks are served. I asked for a second refill of red wine and made the mistake of asking the stewardess serving the seat behind me. First she refused as it was not her section when i looked at her she said I could not serve a second glass of wine for 2 hours. I asked for a feedback form she refused and walked away.

The flight from Mumbai to Delhi was on time and dinner was served on this sector and while the IFE was working initially, it encountered some problems before landing but as this was a short sector it was overlooked. The flight leg from DEL to JFK was completely full and on this flight boarding started one hour earlier and on this 15 hour flight the seats were comfortable although after flying for a long time, signs of age were visible.

Air India,8,V Agarwal,18th March 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | New York to Mumbai via Delhi. The return leg of this flight was around 85% full however the service on this sector provided by the crew was excellent. The flight took off on time which was followed by refreshments/lunch service. The crew were very friendly and full of smiles during the service and after lunch the cabin was dimmed during the rest period. Regular food was offered and the quantity and quality of the food provided was excellent. The seat was fairly comfortable, although showing signs of age which is expected when it has been in service for over a decade. The IFE may not been as vast containing 42738 odd movies like some other airlines but it was adequate enough during the trip and I even managed to watch a couple of movies but was unable to sleep due to infants crying continously and parents unable to pacify their babies but I was still able to rest for 2 hours or so and arrival into Delhi was on time. The remaining leg from DEL to BOM was on the star alliance Boeing 777 which was cool and a hot snack was offered on this route. Landing was on time and baggage was delivered smoothly on the carousel.

Air India,4,Suhail Shafi,11th March 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Newark to Mumbai return. The plane was modern with adequate legroom between seats and seats were rather comfortable. The biggest problem I noted was that the Inflight Entertainment system were not working properly. I sat in one seat and noticed the jack for the headphones would not accept my personal noise cancelling headphones or even the airlines' own headphones. The stewardess working on the flight made an incredulous expression when I pointed this out. I ended up changing seats to another two seats. All of them appeared to have problems with the inflight entertainment systems. Some did not have the touchscreen working. Others did not have their remote working and others had to be repeatedly restarted before they were usable. The flight attendants did not seem too concerned about this problem. I had similar problems on the flight back. Many of the passengers on both flights appeared to have inflight entertainment systems which were non functional or dysfunctional and the Air India entertainment system in general appears to be by far the most user unfriendly system I have ever encountered of any airline. This represents a major inconvenience on lung haul flights which are up to 15 hours in length. The Boeing 777s of Air India do not seem to be well maintained at all. Otherwise the planes are modern with fair catering and flight attendants who do their job while not being friendly. There are better airlines to fly between the US and India, though.",Boeing 777 300 ER,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Mumbai,Feb-18,5,3,3,1,2,3,no

Air India,7,Nafis Ahmed Raiyan,24th February 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | New Delhi to Dhaka via Kolkata. First time flying with Air India. Was a bit excited when I found out I will be flying in the Boeing 787-8 to Kolkata, and from there, connecting flight to Dhaka in an Airbus A319. Check in at Delhi was a bit frustrating because their software were having troubles. So had to wait a bit longer in line. But finally I was directed towards the gate. The plane was prepped in time. While boarding the plane, I was recording video, but a flight attendant by the door of the aircraft gave objection to it. His behaviour was rude. He took my hand and told to delete that video in front of him. I was a bit shocked at his rude behaviour. But I did as he asked. He told me that it is against their policy to record video which I was not aware of. Still, I apologised. Nevertheless, the plane was amazing. The economy window seat which I got had plenty of leg room and great seat incline and massage options. Most importantly, the infotainment system of the aircraft was amazing. I enjoyed that a lot. The plane took of on time. After 40 mins, meal was served. Food was rice, chicken, vegetables, salad, bun with butter along with ingredients to make tea/coffee by yourself. After a 2 hr flight, the plane landed smoothly Then the connecting flight from Kolkata to Dhaka was in an Airbus A319. That aircraft was delayed by 20 mins. The plane had a bit tight legroom. The onboard served snack wasn't good on this one. There was dry, cold Singara and cake. The plane made some noises during the flight. This Aircraft, perhaps ,wasn't properly maintained. Anyways, landed in Dhaka after a 1 hr flight. Overall experience was really good.",Boeing 787-8 / A319,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Dhaka via Kolkata,Jan-18,5,2,4,5,3,4,no

Frontier Airlines,1,D Lewis,16th January 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | The passengers started to get concerned after waiting an hour without departing. Were hardly informed of what was going on until about 1.5 hours later. Flight attendants were nice but said they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a clue what was going on and couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t answer any questions about anyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s connecting flight. We were told navigation wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t turn on as it was a mechanical issue. We waited so long the plane had to go through 30 minute deicing a second time. Aircraft got in line only to turn around back to the gate because we ran out of gas and had to refuel. We were delayed on the tarmac for three hours, they wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let us off. Everyone missed their connecting flight. Not offered any snacks or water. We were then told to get off the plane and wait. Overall it was a 6 hour delay. Waited in line for two hours with only 1 representative working only to be told thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing they can do and no refunds or connecting flights would be given. Called service line while waiting in line and told they wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t refund the Frontier connecting flight ticket as well. Took no responsibility. Also told that if we get on the plane to Denver Ã¢â‚¬Å“all hotels are booked and fullÃ¢â‚¬Â with no connecting flights, so it was basically a huge gamble to go or not. Finally got to Denver told again I wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it to Reno for a critical doc appt. and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m 8 months pregnant. I actually broke down crying and I told them it was unacceptable and eventually they got three of us on another airline that day but we only had 30 min to go get our luggage and go back through TSA. Baggage and our gate were at completely different ends of the airport. TSA line longer than hell. None of us had eaten all day because of Frontier and waiting in line. Again IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m 8 months pregnant running through the airport on no fuel or water. I am very physically fit with this pregnancy but after all the stress and no answers to any questions I became fatigued running through the Denver airport. One lady I was with had GI surgery and they made her run with us. We almost didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it. It was the absolute worst experience IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever been through. I will never fly again, ever, and letting everyone I know not to use this airline. It was appalling. Pay a little extra and make sure you get to your destination. Was offered a $200 voucher which I think is a joke.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Minnesota to Denver Colorado,Jan-18,1,5,1,1,3,1,no
Frontier Airlines,1,Kayla Bacote,10th January 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Flew Frontier Airlines from Miami to Trenton. Horrible airline that I will never fly with again. Firstly they ripped my luggage on the way to Miami and on our way back to Trenton the flight was delayed for almost 2 hours due to the crew not being on time.

Frontier Airlines,1,Mary Lawton,9th January 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Terrible. This is the cheapest airline IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever flown with and they want to charge you for everything and at an outrageous price! To check in one bag with Frontier was $45. We paid $90 for two bags. Delta only charges $25, plus most other flight companies as well. The flight attendants were very kind, but come on, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2018. We know you can afford to give everyone a free drink and some crackers and no charge for it. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never been on an airline where they charged for all items and was actually in shock. Lastly, the seats do not adjust at all. You want to lean back a little and take a nap? Not going to happen! I actually fell asleep sitting up and my head landed on the shoulder of the man sitting next to me so my fiancÃƒÂ© had to move my head onto his shoulder. The seats were hard and covered by plastic/leather material and not cloth so that just added to the uncomfortable part, also made me cold! Frontier is an airline I will never fly on again. Our flight out to Mexico was with Delta and it went perfectly. Direct flight, enjoyed a coffee, leaned back to take a quick nap on a comfortable seat, and the stewards were very kind as well. I will definitely make sure Expedia doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sign us up for different flight companies next trip!",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Mexico to Atlanta,Jan-18,1,3,1,1,1,1,no
Frontier Airlines,8,Holly Garnett,6th January 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Flew Frontier airlines from Ontario (California) to Detroit via Denver on the 15th of December, right in the heat of the Christmas rush. Tickets were cheap, with two one way tickets running us about $200 total. Baggage is a little expensive, around $35 for carry ons and checked, but backpacks count as personal items and are free to carry on. I arranged to bring my emotional support animal and they were amazing about it. After emailing them verification they got back to me within 2 days and updated my account to show accommodations. No issues at all at the airport or on the plane. I do have to say you get what you pay for in some aspects though. We had a 5 hour layover in Denver, there isn't free food or drinks on the plane ($2 per cash only), and the ticket counter before security only opened up 1.5 hours before our 11am flight.

Frontier Airlines,1,Nixon Phannudet,6th January 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | One of the worst flights I've ever been on, when the flight landed we didn't even have a lane open for the flight, we had to wait 10 mins before getting out which was very unprofessional. Then as we get out I find out my flight is delayed. A couple of hours later and I'm tired but couldn't sleep in case I missed my flight. As we landed in Denver, the same thing happened and we had to wait again for a lane to open for our plane again! I don't understand how that happens twice in a row but Frontier is very unprofessional, this isnt the first time this has happened to me with Frontier. I would not recommend Frontier to any of my friends or family, sometimes people have places to be for jobs and work, and delaying the flight could cost them their job not to mention the bad service.",,Business,Economy Class,Milwauke to Las Vegas via Denver,Jan-18,3,1,,1,1,1,yes

Frontier Airlines,1,C Kensit,4th January 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Minneapolis to Denver. I have flown frontier in the past with no issues. I really had wished that would be the case this time around when making a quick trip to Minneapolis for a New Year's concert. This was far from the case. After loading everyone onto the plane, nearly about to take off at 535 in the morning January first there was a maintenance issue which caused us to be delayed until 10 am, with no notification or updates. We had our flight cancelled around noon, after waiting in limbo. Not only that but the rep working was not trained, technically not even a frontier employee but rather from a third party service and she was incredibly rude. We had an emergency at home and needed to try to get there asap, we were exhausted and frustrated with the service and we had to spend about two hours trying to get rebooked and a hotel voucher. They didn't put us on a flight until two days out,and refused us a second day voucher. Instead of arguing further we cancelled our return flight for a refund and had to rent a car to drive home. I will never fly frontier again due to how we were treated in one of the most stressful situations possible.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Denver,Jan-18,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Frontier Airlines,1,R Cooper,2nd January 2018,Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Flew Frontier Airlines from Tampa to Providence. Worst airline hands down. Thought I should try a Ã¢â‚¬Å“budgetÃ¢â‚¬Â airline and I totally regret it. Flight was delayed 9 hours for maintenance. This sucks but is understandable. Problem was all passengers were given no info as gate agent left as people started or get frustrated. Customer service on phone was out of country and confused. Even going to the extent to say the flight was leaving at 2.17 when it was 2.45. Very disappointing. Also plane was really hot and the seats were uncomfortable.,A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Providence,Dec-17,1,3,,1,1,1,no
Frontier Airlines,1,L Ocker,31st December 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Milwaukee to Phoenix. First I will start off by stating the obvious. Hidden fees. I will take responsibility for this due to my own lack of research and assuming there were no carry on fees or seat assignment fees. In return I would like Frontier Airlines to take responsibility for the flight from hell that many of us encountered. There were 3 gate changes and a 5 hour delay including sitting at the gate for over an hour after we were boarded. Nothing was offered to us to make any of us more comfortable. Not even a drink of water. The air quality on the plane was horrible. It was hot, stuffy, and stale. The worst part were the bathrooms. They were filthy. The floors were covered in sticky wet urine that we were forced to step in if we needed to use the restroom. Instead of the flight attendant just standing around staring back at us she could tidy up the restrooms so they are suitable for us. I did pay for a service and do expect my money to count for something other than getting me from point A to point B. I thought possible included in the flight were clean facilities for the passengers and quality air to breathe. I did call customer service asking for some type of compensation other than a $25 voucher to fly with them again and was denied. I will never use that $25 voucher because I don't plan on flying with Frontier again. I expect some sort of standards when I fly and for the airline to take some pride in what they do. Because the flight arrived the next day, I also had to pay for additional parking. Frontier offered nothing. So disappointed in this airline.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Milwaukee to Phoenix,Dec-17,1,1,,,1,1,no
Frontier Airlines,1,R Larcas,29th December 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Austin to Las Vegas. Issues with their online booking system (not on my end) caused $400 in extra fees, making it more expensive than a full service airline. When I called to resolve the issue, the only other option given is to cancel with no refund. The extra baggage fees are crazy, and no one ever checked for a receipt to show I had paid. If you want to be sure your children can be next to you, they force you to pay for your seat assignment. My son was seated away from us by himself, even though he was booked with my family and has the same last name. They would only move us together if I paid an additional $60 each seat for my family of 4. The seats have no padding, are seriously uncomfortable, are even closer than normal, and do not lean back at all. Snacks and sodas are additional $5 or more each.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Las Vegas,Dec-17,1,1,,1,1,2,yes
Frontier Airlines,1,P Marshall,29th December 2017,Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Milwaukee to Phoenix. They have the worst customer service. The plane was delayed for over 3 hours with mechanical issues.

Frontier Airlines,1,C Marisa,28th December 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Orlando to Minneapolis. So my trip to Minneapolis was not bad, pilot flew the plane great, flight attendant was great. What I didn't like is that I felt there was no professionalism, staff was on their phone chit chatting not paying attention. Anyway this was my first flight on Frontier and it will be the last, they charge you fees for everything, the luggage I could understand but what I don't get is why charge me for seat assignment. Isn't that why i bought my ticket. I was flying with my two younger daughters (8 and 2 year old) and I had to spend an extra $300 round trip and that's only for luggage and seat assignment, so in all I paid $900 for all three of us. I chose them because of how inexpensive their prices were, but I guess you pay for what you get. To top it off, they lost my baggage on a straight flight, that makes no sense what so ever. Anyways Frontier has lost me as a customer and I will pay the extra money for Delta or Jetblue that gives you free luggage, free seat selection, free snacks on board and excellent customer service. They deserve a -1 in my books.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Minneapolis,Dec-17,2,2,1,1,1,2,no
Frontier Airlines,1,S Neale,27th December 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Denver to Salt Lake City. This was the worst flight I have ever been on. They boarded all passenger's 2.5 hours before we even took off. The flight attendants were terrible, didn't even apologize for the disaster of the delay in take off, the exhaust fumes during the wait caused me one of the worst headaches I have ever had.

When it came time to check in online, it wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t allow me the option to check my bags after several attempts. I got to the airport to check my bags and the fee was a whopping $45 for the first bag and $35 for the carryon and they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t accept cash. The rates would have been slightly cheaper for checking in online, I explained to the clerk that I tried to check in several times online and it wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let me. She gave me a number to call. I got my boarding pass and I got to the gate and it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a seat assignment so I had to get out of line and wait to be issued and new boarding pass. So the flight was actually more expensive than the other flights after they charge high rates for your bags.

Frontier Airlines,1,S Halson,26th December 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | New Orleans to San Antonio. Christmas Day my return flight is 2 hr 53 min delayed. No issues with flight here last week. They canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fly me out on another airline because they arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t affiliated with any. The phone customer service people are those outsourced overseas help desk people. They have no stake in customer satisfaction because they arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t invested in the company. This ticket was half the price of the Southwest Airlines one but you get what you pay for. This was my first and last time I am ever flying this airline. You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t run a company like this. On the mobile app, no indication or information about flight delay. No customer service at the gate and no display at the gate to let folks know there is a delay or what to do. In flight - They sell you a credit card on the flight. You have to pay for everything, they wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even bring you water.

Frontier Airlines,1,James Buckland,26th December 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | La Guardia to Atlanta. Seats are too small, you have to buy any snacks or drinks, have to pay for carry on bags. That being said this was my first and last time using this airline. Plane was one hour late - once we did board there was a customer that would not comply and instead of removing him on the spot so the rest of us could get home on Christmas Eve they waited about 30 mins until 2 NYPD officers came on and took the person off. That put us basically 2 hours late from departing. Being in the Military I have used pretty much every airline there is and this is by far the worst. Traveling is expensive already but to charge for something that should be complimentary is absurd. Not a big review person but this was the most horrible flying experience in my life.

While flying Frontier Airlines last February, the stewardess convinced me to sign up for their frequent flier program. She said it's the best program and miles don't expire. So I paid $80 to sign up for their credit card. To my surprise, I logged in my account the other day and saw that on December 14th, my miles had ""expired!"".

Frontier Airlines,1,Halea Connell,19th December 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Cheap air fair, but the customer care is horrendous. I had a flight from Atlanta to Austin, $77 round trip. Seemed unbelievable (as I should have known, it was). Beyond just uncomfortable seating, they do not care about what is best for their customers. I had my flight scheduled but it was canceled due to snow hitting GA. If you know anything about the south, we don't get snow often. So when we do, everyone goes crazy, despite Atlanta only getting a few inches. Something I would assume these planes are equipped for since they fly to cities like Chicago and New York during the winter months. So, I had taken time off work but wound up rescheduling my flight for the following weekend, leaving me to take off even more time from work but I didn't see this as a major downfall if it meant visiting a close friend. Well, of course, this weekend happened to be the weekend Hartsfield Jackson had a power outage. So here I am again, dealing with another canceled flight from Frontier--despite the fact that the power returned Sunday night and my plane wasn't landing until 2pm on Monday. Other airlines were still flying in on Monday, yes maybe the power outage only affected certain airlines but I am still unsure as to why Frontier had to cancel on Monday when everything was fixed Sunday night. So, Frontier gives me the option of rebooking my flight for no additional costs. Awesome! Nope. The next flight they could offer me was on Friday with a connecting flight in Denver (sounds like too many hours on a Frontier plane already, right?). Plus it wasn't realistic for me to stay five additional days! Money is needed and I can only make money if I work but alas, I cannot work if I am not in Georgia. Frontier offers to give me a refund. For $33. If you travel frequently, you know $33 isn't going to do jack shit for a last minute flight home the week of Christmas. To fly out on Monday tickets were as ""cheap"" as $800. I wound up booking a flight for Tuesday for $280. Frontier then offered me a $50 voucher. As if I ever want to fly with them again. I called and spoke with a supervisor to see if they could give me a refund or compensate for my flight. He told me repeatedly that it ""wasn't their fault,"" and I politely reminded him that the power outage was not my fault either, nor was the $280 ticket I had to buy home. He demeaned me by reminding me that a $50 voucher along with a $33 refund is more than what I spent in the first place--as if I could not do that math on my own. I understood that fully but that voucher still wasn't helping me with the extra $280 I had to pay out of pocket around the holidays. He refused to give me a full refund, despite me saying I would prefer that over the voucher, and continued to speak down to me as if I did not understand that the power outage wasn't their fault. Not only were they not willing to work with me, each person I spoke with treated me as if I were an idiot and didn't understand the circumstances. The man kept reiterating that this was a loss for Frontier too. Well, it's going to continue to be an even bigger loss for them if they continue to treat their customers like this. I will never fly with Frontier again. Spend the extra $100, fly with Delta. They seem to be handling the power outage with grace and dignity. Maybe Frontier could learn a thing or two from them if they really want a chance at being a big airline.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Atlanta,Dec-17,1,2,,,1,2,no
Frontier Airlines,1,Monica Pojas,18th December 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Austin to Ontario. Tickets are inexpensive but the ticket we bought my granddaughter was purchased a week after us on the phone she is 3 years old. The lady on the phone said she was linked to me an adult on the plane. When we got to Austin they said it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t linked to me but she put her with one of the adults in our party. On our way back from Ontario the airline would not sit her with one of us, they said it was a full flight! Then they said I could get a seat next to her but I had to pay for a preferred seatt! That they expect a 3 year old to be able to ride on a plane by themselves! The supervisor said her children minors fly by themselves. As a supervisor you need to use common sense.

Frontier Airlines,1,K Daniels,12th December 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Flew Washington DC Regan to Denver CO. Frontier is the worst airline in business. They charge you for the flight obviously, but then you have to pay $45 for your checked bag, $50 for the second, $25 for a carry on and so on. If you want a water or soda, have your credit card ready. Nothing is free. I'm surprised they don't charge you for oxygen, life vest, restroom use, etc. The flight crews were miserable from the Captain down to the flight attendants. It felt more like Con Air. They make it seem like a cost efficient way to travel, but I would rather walk without shoes in a snowstorm for 500 miles. The seats are like sitting on concrete and don't recline. We will never ever fly with them again. Not worth it! Flying Southwest or Delta would have been a better choice.",,Business,Economy Class,Washington DC Regan to Denver CO,Dec-17,1,1,1,1,1,1,yes
Frontier Airlines,9,S Ranken,7th December 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | New Orleans to Orlando. After a fun filled four days in New Orleans, my 74 year old mother was feeling worn out. She had hurt herself and hurt her knee. So, I checked us in with a wheelchair box marked to ensure Mom would not have to walk. We arrived to the airport almost 2 hr early and the agent greeted us with a cheery smile & checked our luggage. There wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a line but a steady flow of customers. We watched him for a long time as after 40 minutes and 3 calls no wheelchair person had come. He was so cheerful & great in his customer interactions that every passenger walked away smiling. Since I had explained I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t push Mom & take our coats etc. he took us himself when no one else ever came. He was reassuring & got us to the gate just in time for our flight. He is an asset to the staff at Frontier. In a strange twist, there was a medical emergency on our flight. While I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t remember the attendants names, I must say, they were on it. I was a nurse on a medical surgical floor and this is the fast kind of response needed. Fortunately, there were two DrÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on board but all in all the whole experience impressed. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been to over 50 countries & fly all the time, this was one of the best airline experiences we have had. I paid $19.40 for these tickets. For all these low star reviews I say, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expect luxury for pennies and when it counted frontier staff acted just as they should and super professionally!",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Orlando,Dec-17,3,5,3,,5,5,no

Very big mistake after an hour late departure from Orlando due to overloaded flight, one of the mechanics forgot to close the fuel cap panel so after just an hour of flight and after losing hundreds of gallons of fuel, the plane had to land in New Orleans where they left us for 4 hrs. Not having anybody from the airline to talk to, to at least find out what the problem was, 4 hrs later they showed up with a few pizzas, trying to buy you out, and still coming out with lies because apparently nobody knew what was going on.

I travel back and forth from Colorado Springs to Los Angeles for meetings and they have cost me a lot of money not being on time. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve now missed my first very meeting which has messed up my whole day. Very disappointed in the way they charge as well.

Frontier Airlines,1,C Tervin,23rd November 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Houston to Denver. Thanksgiving November 23, 2017 5am at the ticket counter. Got there 5 mins after 45 min cut off time for check bags but still plenty of time for the flight. Houston Intercontinental terminal A is relatively close to check in and gate. Frontier told us to take our checked bags through the TSA screening. Mins pass by as they consult if they can let the bag through. After viewing the x-ray back and forth they said I had to remove 5-10 items. By the time we got the ones that we needed to discard out our terminal gates closed right in front of our eyes. We were a family of 4 along with 8 other passengers were left stranded and all accounted for in front of the gate. Now tell me how does Frontier let this happen to 12 people on Thanksgiving Day? I called 801-401-9000 (frontier customer service) and customer service rep said Ã¢â‚¬Å“This May be a special day for you but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just another day for us at Frontier.Ã¢â‚¬Â That really was the tipping point. We are all looking for a good deal but if the trade off is to be treated like you're non-existent is unacceptable. Their front counter staff to the customer service support number should be fired if not retrained.

Frontier Airlines,8,Rose Cacho,21st November 2017,"Ã¢ÂÂŽ Not Verified | Raleigh Durham to Las Vegas. The flight was not that bad. For the price I paid it was worth it. If I have anything to complain about is the cost of inflight drinks. A small bottle of water or a can of soda for $3.00? That is a bit too extreme, and, if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a debit/credit card youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re out of luck. Aside from the above issues, my biggest complaint is that the seats donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t recline and that the airline nickel and dime you for everything.

Frontier Airlines,1,L Gearer,21st November 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Omaha to San Francisco via Denver. Couldn't get a working boarding pass. After I checked in on your website using my laptop, I never got an email confirmation with a boarding pass as I do with all other airlines. So, I logged back in to your website and went to print the boarding pass, but since I didn't have a printer, I just took a screenshot and sent that to my phone. I arrived at the airport 45 minutes before the flight with just a laptop back. I thought I'd go to the check-in counter and get a proper boarding pass just in case, but the woman said that it was closed and she had no way to print a boarding pass. I checked my phone and it was exactly 45 minutes before the departure time. So, I went to security and tried to use my screen shot of the boarding pass and we couldn't make it work. I then went back to the website using my phone and I couldn't find any way pull up the boarding pass again. TSA said they couldn't let me in with a boarding pass that would scan. So, I went back down to the check-in counter and was told again that they had no way to print a boarding pass as they were completely locked out 45 minutes before the flight. And, the one self check-in kiosk was broken. The woman the check-in counter was absolutely unhelpful. Her only suggestion was that I buy a ticket for the United flight that was leaving 15 minutes later. I didn't even get a sincere apology. There was a guy standing around and I'm still not sure if he worked for Frontier or not as he didn't have a uniform, but he heard what was going on and suggested I install your app. After a few minutes getting that setup, I was finally able to get a boarding pass on my phone that worked and I made my flight just a couple of minutes before the doors closed. I've been flying 30 to 50 flights a year for the past 40 years and while I've had problems in the past, I've never seen such a complete breakdown of the check-in process as this. First, I should have received a boarding pass in my email (yes, you had the right email address and no it didn't go to my junk mail). Second, it's ridiculous that your agent can't print a boarding pass 45 minutes before a flight departs even when a customer is not checking a bag. Third, there should be at least one working kiosk that can print the pass. Fourth, there should be an obvious way to view the boarding pass on the website. I had been able to on my laptop by clicking the check-in button, but when I opened the browser on my phone, even though I had already checked in that button was disabled (I supposed again because of the 45 minute issue). I can't afford to miss flights because the airline can't figure out it's check-in system and I'm done flying Frontier.",,Business,Economy Class,Omaha to San Francisco via Denver,Nov-17,3,1,1,1,1,3,no
Frontier Airlines,2,Ashley Lohrmeyer,19th November 2017,"Ã¢ÂÂŽ Not Verified | Orlando to Colorado Springs. From the start of this flight it was an absolute mess. I got to the airport for my 6:30 flight over 2 hours early. The line for luggage checking was ridiculously long with only 3 people checking bags. We were told only certain lines were for certain flights, but nothing was labeled so new people coming had no clue what they were supposed to do. One line they later said wasn't a line. When we got to the counter they told us we were in the wrong line (after having waited an hour). The desk staff was extremely rude and unorganized for such a large airport. Then at our gate, 20 min after boarding should have started they tell us the plane just landed from Cancun and there was a security check that would last at least 20 min. (Except the fact the plane was already at the gate 30 mins, or more before that) the flight was delayed over 45 min, for a 6:30am flight. What an absolutely terrible experience.

Frontier Airlines,2,K Thomson,18th November 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Washington to Las Vegas via Denver. I describe Frontier Airlines as ""they get you there"". I say this because the planes are uncomfortable and the flight plans are pretty rough, especially if you are buying tickets during a promotion. The promotional times generally cover weekdays, less Friday. And the flight plans during those days generally involve stopping in Denver, which could be 1 hour or up to 3 hours. Denver airport is very big, and comfortable, but it is a pain to stopover for west-bound travel. I do recommend the cheap $20 travel insurance. There seems to be a high incidence of delays with flights. My flight from Las Vegas was delayed by a half hour because of crew issues. My flight from San Francisco the week prior was cancelled because of the pilot thinking there was a huge maintenance issue. The cancellation resulted in my wife and I getting $200 vouchers, which I guess was a result of having the travel insurance. $400 free, great. But now we have to fly with Frontier again, and I have to use the vouchers within 3 months of issuance (ugh). Frontier is a budget airline, and I get what that involves - fees for everything. I just wish that they would be a bit more focused on their budget status. Budget airline implies they want to fly as many minutes possible and be on the ground as few minutes as possible. Meaning, the quicker it takes to load the plane the more money they make since they can fly more. I would like to know if European airlines do this, but Frontier should be different from all the standard airlines and load the plane from the back first instead of by zone, mostly front first. Yes, I understand that this may result in the people who pay for seat upgrades (which are in the first 5 rows of the plane) to possibly lose the ability to stow their carry-on because of limited bin space, but perhaps they should force people who take the cheap option (like me) to check their baggage. Already there is a $5 incentive to check baggage when you buy tickets. It is usually $30 to carry-on a bag and $25 to check it. I chose to save those $5 and checked one big bag for my wife and I. They should make the incentive bigger for the cheap-minded passengers, like $15 or something because there are still too many people carrying bags on, and carry-ons slow down the boarding process. Perhaps they should setup a system wherein they limit the number of carry-on purchases based on bin space, with priority given to those who pay for seat upgrades. Like other budget airlines, everything comes at a cost - $10 for not printing a boarding pass at home (rarely enforced), cost for food on-board, cost for upgraded seats, cost for selecting a seat at check-in (if you must select a seat for free, you need to do it early and you are limited to the center seat in the last 10 rows or so). Just select no seat and let the system do it for you. The worst part of frontier is the seat. The width and the leg room are pretty standard, and the seat base cushion is fine, but the seat back is horrible. It is a layer of plastic covered by a thin layer of padding and then a thin layer of leather. And the backs don't recline. It is super uncomfortable to try sleeping. The trays are small, so good luck putting your head down. The next time I fly Frontier (which will be the last time I fly, thanks to the vouchers) I will pay for the seat upgrade to the front 5 rows which are more like Delta's seats, comfortable and they recline.",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Las Vegas via Denver,Nov-17,1,2,1,,2,2,no

Switching from Oneworld to Star Alliance seems to have been a good idea since the quality of the product is way better. The planes I got to fly in were new and the seats very comfortable. At check-in, the operator at the business class desk, apologized for taking a person flying economy and that I had to wait for 2 minutes. I found that sweet. The flight attendants were very friendly and attentive and it really makes a difference in the sky, even when flying just under 2 hours. Speaking of the flight attendants, their uniform was somehow strange, everything red, including shoes and stockings: unique indeed. I must say the food in business class was incredible and the selection of wines was everything I needed for my trip. Everything culminated with a cup of tea, served in Austrian's branded porcelain. Both flights were on time and connecting in Vienna, while not the quickest and not always stress free, made it possible for the whole trip OTP-VIE-TXL to be under 4h. The WiFi didn't seem to work.

Austrian Airlines,3,S Lakatec,5th May 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Mauritius to Vienna was disappointing in various aspects. The business class cabin crew's attitude and poor performance in service have been the key problem. After boarding, there was no help with luggage or seating to anybody. Once some crew members realized that we do not speak German, they lost any interest to communicate with us at all. With the exception of personal welcome from the main purser and only one flight attendant, the rest of the crew did not care for a majority of this long-haul daytime flight. After the take-off, the breakfast has been served. Then, the crew gave up almost to be presented for the passengers, or at least to ensure to refill in some frequency any kind of drinks at the Ã¢â‚¬Å“minibarÃ¢â‚¬Â in the galley. When someone from the crew has Ã¢â‚¬Å“checkedÃ¢â‚¬Â the cabin, it was the high speed run through the aisle. I was lucky to call the flight attended and asked her for a drink, as there had been nothing in the galley minibar at that time. No answer, but the face told enough, that I had exceeded some unwritten limit perhaps. Absolutely unbelievable. The more offended face, when she came back with the drink. The lunch, served about 3 hours prior the landing, was delicious. With the mentioned exception of that one professional flight attendant, nobody has cared about the passengers (no refilled drinks again, no talks, no motivation to look professional at least). At Vienna airport the plane (B772) parked at the remote stand with totally disorganized bus transfer into overcrowded terminal building. But it is another story.

Austrian Airlines,1,Lisa Chung,24th March 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | I booked economy flights from Copenhagen to Vienna for my husband and myself for 4 January 2018. As we were travelling in Europe during the winter for several weeks, we had more luggage than allowed under our ticket. The airline website encouraged purchasing extra luggage allowance online as it was cheaper than on arrival at the airport when checking in. I tried to do this several times but the website would not accommodate the request. A day or 2 before the flight, we were offered an upgrade to business class at a cost of Ã¢â€šÂ¬119 each, which we took up. The receipts for payment for the upgrades clearly showed an increased baggage allowance to 32kgs each which was more than sufficient for us. On arrival at the airport in Copenhagen for check in, the check in agent would not allow the increased luggage without further payment as it was her contention that the upgrade we paid for did not include increased luggage. At our request she called the airline twice but was told that we would have to pay extra DKK559. As we had no option, we paid the demanded amount. I lodged a complaint with the airlineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“guest serviceÃ¢â‚¬Â team, attaching a copy of my receipt showing the increased baggage allowance as part of the business class upgrade. I also requested a refund of the DKK559 I had paid. I exchanged several emails with the Ã¢â‚¬Å“guest serviceÃ¢â‚¬Â team before I was then informed that I would have to lodge my request anew with the airlineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s feedback/complaints department via its website. I re-lodged my complaint/request as instructed and received an acknowledgement. I have received at least 2 further emails advising the airline Ã¢â‚¬Å“is committed to offering a high quality of service and your concern is therefore important to us. However, due to a high volume of requests, you may experience a delay in receiving a responseÃ¢â‚¬Â. My complaint/request was first lodged on 4 January, almost 4 months ago and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m still waiting for a response to something that should be very straightforward.",,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Copenhagen to Vienna,Jan-18,2,2,1,,1,1,no
Austrian Airlines,4,P Cooper,24th March 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | This was my first time flying Austrian Airlines on 2 small connecting flights: Munich-Vienna / Vienna-Iasi. I have to mention that I mostly fly low cost. I didn't expect any incredible inflight service because of the type of flight and destinations. Overall flight was good, snacks a bit small compared to most other ""normal"" airlines. However one thing felt exceptionally below service, especially for a Star Alliance airline. We were departing from MUC to VIE and I came to my seat amongst the last and the overhead was full. I was carrying 1 cabin trolley, plus my purse and laptop which I always put under my seat. With no place to put my cabin compliant trolley, I turned to the flight attendant for help, literally saying ""could you please help me stow my trolley, not sure where to put it"". She shrugged her shoulders in a very obvious ""and what do you want me to do?"" manner and said ""the overhead is full due to passengers bringing 2 pieces of large luggage"" and proceeded to not moving an inch, while looking at me. Then another passenger helped me make room in the overhead (probably his backpacks were there). I could have just pushed some random overhead bags really hard or asked some passengers to take out their smaller backpack and put it under their seat but really, I think this would have been rude on my side - I wouldn't want a stranger smushing my bags or asking me to move my stuff. I also strongly believe it is the flight attendant's job. It clearly *is* for all the low cost flights where flight attendants are taking really good care of this aspect. So I am expecting much more from a Star Alliance company that charges double or more of what a low cost would. At least I am expecting the willingness to be helped with basic things. If you can't be bothered to help me stow my luggage, I find that a problem, especially given the price I am paying. The rest of the flight attendands were great, accommodating, and we had some of the most talkative and informative captains on all of the Austrian flights - which I liked.",A321,Business,Economy Class,Munich to Vienna,Mar-18,3,2,2,,3,2,no

Both flights were on time, with the outbound one even arriving well before schedule. One the reasons for that might have been the surprisingly efficient boarding on both occasions. Check-in went smoothly at both airports, even though the counter was rather difficult to find in IAD, due to virtually non-existent information screens at that airport. Ground staff was always friendly. On both flights, cabin crew was very friendly and hard-working, running up and down to serve drinks throughout the whole flight. The food was very good and the onboard entertainment satisfactory. The plane was a seemingly modern B-767 with 2-3-2 seating and enough legroom, so that even as a tall man I was able to get some sleep.",Boeing 767,Business,Economy Class,Washington to Vienna,Jan-18,5,5,4,4,5,4,yes
Austrian Airlines,2,K Gabler,18th January 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | I was very frustrated, not to say shocked with the apparently new Austrian service plan. First, Austrian puts 10 seats in one row of a 777 (3-4-3), while other airlines fly with 9 seats per row only. That by itself makes it hard to feel comfortable, since you are always in direct contact with the neighbour's shoulder. The worst however is the service. The food consisted of a 2 cm by 2 cm large piece of meat, a spoon of mashed potatoes and one carrot (see photo), served in a disposable triangle. Drinks were only offered once, following the new service plan of Austrian. When I complained about food and service one of the flight crew members told me that this is the new service directive and food service from Austria. The crew were not happy with it either and indeed felt embarrassed about the quality. All these little extras, that make a flight a little bit more comfortable are missing on Austrian. The nuts and drinks prior to the dinner, the hot (paper) towels prior to dinner and breakfast, nobody went through the cabin offering drinks. I emphasize, that I do not blame the crew. Indeed, they were all very friendly and helped as much as they could. But what can you do if there is not enough food/drinks on board and the company asks you to reduce the service to an absolute minimum. Well, I made my decision. Austrian long haul flights, never again.",Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Vienna,Jan-18,1,1,1,3,4,2,no

The cabin crew was very friendly and kind that they smiled all the time. The inflight entertainment provides a wide variety of choice as well. The cabin was new and clean. Everyone got a blanket and a pillow. The flight arrived punctually.,Boeing 777-200ER,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Vienna,Dec-17,5,5,5,5,5,5,yes
Austrian Airlines,6,Marian Ruzicka,12th January 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Had a rather frustrating experience in December, my connection flight from Toronto to Vienna has been cancelled due to technical problems. Austrian refused to re-book it and insisted it had to be done by my booking agent, FlightCentre. FlightCentre did get me alternate flight with other airlines but told me it should have been done by Austrian. And on the return flight from Vienna to Toronto the same issue, presumably with the same plane - the departure flight got delayed a couple of times, then it was cancelled after a delay of nearly 5 hours. I was not pleased and wowed to never fly Austrian again. Fortunately, this time they did much better, provided the customers with a airport hotel and food, and best of all - early next morning they got me to Paris and my final destination in Vancouver by another carrier (Air France). Because of this, I would give them another chance in the future and the professional and prompt resolution of the second cancellation improved my opinion of the airline a lot. Why on earth did not behave the same way in December?",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kosice to Toronto via Vienna,Jan-18,3,4,4,3,3,4,yes
Austrian Airlines,9,Anders Pedersen,5th January 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Copenhagen - Vienna - Hong Kong on 3rd Jan 2018. (Billund) - Copenhagen - Vienna - Hong Kong on A320 and B777-300, respectively. The short leg CPH-VIE seat had a terrible economy seat offering to business class passengers. Food was very sparse and only 1 hot dish was offered, completely in contrast to the international luxury offerings (see below). However, good FAs. Champagne offered. Check-in in BLL (Denmark) with a useless, inert, junior agent (3rd party, SAS-agent) could not identify my onwards bookings (despite providing boarding cards as prof) and rejected to check-in my luggage further than HKG. The long haul flight VIE-HKG was one of my best flights ever. Have been missing Austrian for its innovations, fresh and super-alert FAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, colours, decos, and excellent food. 3 Austrian beers offered, one in original bottles. 2 champagnes, lots of reds and whites. For Lunch I consumed two main-dishes: the calf was devine. Also, an Italian cheese-pasta was very nice. 3 hot meals offered on this 12 hours flight: they had each 3, 1, and 2 hot offerings, respectively (for lunch, supper, and breakfast). The VIE-HKG was full but the FA coped well: smiling, attentive, focused, proactive, and caring. The flight was 10/10 but the seat could not recline to horizontal position (lacking 3-5 degrees). The handset controller did not work. Further, the flight CPH-VIE on a A320 cannot exceed an 8/10 score. Altogether, an exotic, focused airline of high quality. Luggage arrived smoothly. I will go again. Much better than Swiss and Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in this case: also better than Qatar and Turkish.","A320, Boeing 777-300",Family Leisure,Business Class,Copenhagen to Hong Kong via Vienna,Jan-18,4,5,5,5,4,4,yes
Austrian Airlines,8,Kah Kay Au,3rd January 2018,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Vienna to Bangkok. I was initially booked on Economy on OS1015. At the gate, the gate agent offered an upgrade to Premium Economy for Ã¢â€šÂ¬149. I grabbed the opportunity to try out their Premium Economy product as this was my first time travelling long haul on Austrian Airlines. So I picked up my new boarding pass and settled into seat 10H which was the first row of Premium Economy. The seating configuration was 2-4-2 instead of 3-4-3 in Economy. Seat pitch was generous and incline was good giving me a good sleep for the 9.5 hour red eye flight. However, the earphones were of the in-ear type and sound quality was not good. I would have expected over-ear headphones for Premium Economy. No amenity kit was distributed but I guess this is standard practice for the majority of European airlines on their economy and premium economy products. Catering was of course economy catering. Overall, AustrianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Premium Economy product was good and service was efficient. It was worth the extra Ã¢â€šÂ¬149 paid.",Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Vienna to Bangkok,Jan-18,4,4,3,3,4,4,yes
Austrian Airlines,6,D Karimancic,31st December 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Chicago to Vienna on their Boeing 767, with a very nice interior and a great entertainment system. Austrian's impeccably trained and very well-groomed cabin crew were at the top of their game both times. I also had a great experience with kind airport agents. My first issue - seat selection for a booking made via United was not available on Austrian's website for the segments of my itinerary they operated. I was assigned random seats when I checked in. Lufthansa on the other hand allow seat selection on their website for segments they operate, even when you book via United. My second issue was food. You'd expect that on a 9 hour overnight flight they'd pamper you more in terms of food (beverage service is pretty varied, but I care more about food service. On the long-haul flight for dinner they have a choice of two dishes with a limited amount of servings available, so that when one is gone, you are stuck with the other. The assumption that everyone will automatically accept what is left has proven wrong in my case, because for personal reasons, I didn't want the pasta with that was left, but the dish that was gone (chicken). As they couldn't accommodate my request, I asked if they had any snacks for purchase. They first misunderstood me and gave me 3 more bags of some salty crackers that they had served as a starter. I was told the only thing they had for purchase was chocolate (I assume as a part of their duty-free offer). It turned out my only option was to eat the dish that they had left, buy chocolate or stay hungry. Before landing we were served a muffin for breakfast. I personally do not like having sweets as a meal.",Boeing 767,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Vienna,Dec-17,3,4,2,5,5,3,yes
Austrian Airlines,1,Irina Kreger,19th December 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Chicago to Vienna. The worst experience I had. I was traveling with 11 month old baby, just 2 of us. It was really hard but the stuff weren't that helpful. My baby really active and I put tray with food on floor, so he doesn't mess with it and When time came to clean I asked the steward to clean it and he roll his eyes on me and said "" Are you serious put it on floor what I suppose to clean your mess after you now"".",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Vienna,Nov-17,3,2,3,,1,1,no
Austrian Airlines,3,S Robinson,1st December 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Vienna - Paris CDG in Economy almost a year ago, transferring in CDG to an AF flight to the UK. Flight was booked with AF as a codeshare. Checked in at the manned premium OS counter (due to frequent flyer status), which was fast and friendly. Boarding Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as almost in VIE with OS - slightly chaotic, but an average experience, as well as the flight itself. Solid, but not more. Drinks were free, however Austrian Airlines does not serve actual food in Y. Flight was delayed by 15 minutes due to a ATC slot, which should not have been an issue, but it was. We had a scheduled transfer time of 1 hour, which was now reduced to 45 minutes. While we made it to the new gate before departure time, the flight was already closed. CDG is a disaster and even the scheduled transfer time of one hour would have been not enough to be at the gate before the official flight closing time. Long lines at passport control with no special lines for EU-passports and no short connection lines. Also, nobody there from the airline or the airport to assist with short connections. Then a bus transfer between the terminals that seemed to circle the whole airport with multiple stops and which took almost 30 minutes. CDG has to be the worst organized airport in Europe. No chance to make the connection. AF then rebooked us to flight leaving 6 hours later. Then we had to wait 1 hour (!) at the counter till AF got the approval from OS to issue a meal voucher for the delay, but OS could not care less to and needed to be called multiple time before they finally sent an approval. Simply ridiculous. Also, compensation for the delay under EU law was denied by OS citing extraordinary circumstances. How can a slightly later ATC slot be extraordinary circumstances? This is business as usual and flight statistics show that this is the usual delay for this morning flight. Even an intervention by the Austrian Customer Protection Agency did not help. OS denied their reasoning, as well. Will not recommend OS, as customer service and attitude handling the delay and compensation was terrible.",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vienna to Paris CDG,Dec-16,4,3,3,,4,2,no
Austrian Airlines,10,H Moser,9th November 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Flew Beijing to Vienna. Check in at PEK airport smooth and fast. Once on the plane warmly welcomed by the purser by name. The plane took off one hour late because of chinese airtraffic control. Just waiting beside the runway for taking off but still managed an almost on time arrival at VIE airport. The food on Austrian business class is always a dream. I could choose between 8 different starters from the cart, an additional soup, 3 main dishes and 5 different kinds of dessert. The dessert is normally served like in a Vienna cafe with a choice of many different types of coffee. I took my favorite one, Vienna ice coffee. The flight attendants are always friendly and offered frequently drinks and snacks during the flight. Since Austrian modified the business class cabin a few years ago I prefer to travel Austrian business than LH first class. I am a star alliance gold member and if I want to travel on time with a good service than I know that I have to choose Austrian as my carrier.",Boeing 767,Business,Business Class,Beijing to Vienna,Nov-17,5,5,5,5,5,5,yes
Austrian Airlines,1,S Borseva,6th November 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Graz to Sofia via Vienna. I have flown with Austrian Airlines for the first time and I was really disappointed. In the same week, they managed to be late on three out of four flights of mine with them. When I had lost my connecting flight, because the first flight was delayed, the personnel at the airport were extremely rude and not really willing to help find a solution for my situation. Apart from that Vienna Airport is not user friendly, uncomfortable chairs everywhere, not a single spot where you can take a nap and so on.",,Business,Economy Class,Graz to Sofia via Vienna,Nov-17,3,2,1,1,2,3,no
Austrian Airlines,1,Mary M King,5th November 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | My flight (0S88) over to Vienna was fine but on the way back on September 3rd is where the problem lies. Checked in and was given the opportunity to upgrade on FLT 0087 to business class. There was a delay and after several hours the flight was cancelled. They would not refund my credit card for the upgrade even though they just charged it several house prior. Took many hours in the airport to be rescheduled for another flight. That flight was the next day(8/4) and I was booked on Air Berlin to Berlin and then Delta to NY JFK. Air Berlin took off late and I was refused boarding on Delta. The airport in Berlin had an Austrian Airlines and Air Berlin representation. After hours of waiting in lines both companies did nothing to help me at all. Found out Air Berlin was in bankruptcy. Both said they were not direct company employees and could not give compensation for being stuck again another day. Delta re booked for the next day (8/5). No one took responsibility. Finally arrived home in Florida on September 6, with a hurricane bearing down on the state. My luggage? Lost somewhere in Berlin. Finally received it on September 12.

Austrian Airlines,10,Mark Hall,1st October 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Flew Manchester to Klagenfurt via Vienna. Just like to say how smoothly everything went. Austrian allow web check-in 47 hours in advance which was very convenient. Both flights were on time, friendly crew and free catering (packet of snacks and beverages, including wine on international sector), even a quick cuppa from VIE-KLU, which all made for pleasant hop across to central Europe. Seat was fine, of leather and reclined. I'm a fan of the smaller aircraft, so enjoyed both flights. Vienna was a doddle (impressed) from getting off the plane to next gate with a bus transfer, passport and security checks - 15mins! Only had 40mins transfers time, no rush at all and luggage arrived safely too.

Two of the four times my baggage hasn't arrived on time and takes at least 2 days to arrive to the required destination. Austrian Airlines always offers this route with a maximum of 1.5 hours transit at Vienna (either way). If they cannot offer speedy bag transfer they should by default increase their transit time.

Another pleasant flight with Austrian, meal was fine, frequent drinks services, crew happy to provide an extra snack or drink. Plane's entertainment system was well stocked with plenty of good movies and music.

Austrian Airlines,9,N Shannon,16th August 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Flight OS81 from Vienna to Los Angeles. I had flown Austrian only once before, and it was a relatively good experience, so I was expecting a lot out of Austrian. Fortunately, I was very impressed. Check-in was relatively slow, but the lady there gave us a warm greeting and sent our checked bags away quickly. The flight was fully booked, so there were plenty of people in line. The gate felt extremely small, especially on a fully booked flight. Austrian fortunately was good at crowd control, so people got to their respective seats quickly. The seat was clean and very comfortable, and had all the basic functions and necessities you would expect. Pillows and blankets were provided on this 11 hour and 40 minute flight, even though it was a day flight. The flight attendants, as always, were extremely kind and compassionate and always there when you needed them. Soon after takeoff, lunch was served. It was a mushroom pasta dish, which was pretty tasty. The IFE worked pretty well and was responsive, although it didn't have many movies or TV shows, unlike Lufthansa. Where Austrian makes up for this is in their prestigious service and delicious food. Snacks and drinks were served consistently throughout the flight. Near the end of our flight, a small meal of more pasta with olives and zucchini was served with some sort of pudding. It was phenomenal. We parked at one of LAX's satellite terminals, and had to get bused over to Terminal 6 for Customs, which I find a bit inefficient. Overall, it was a fantastic flight. I would definitely recommend Austrian Airlines to anyone.",Boeing 777-200,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Vienna to Los Angeles,Aug-17,5,5,5,4,3,4,yes

I usually travel with a backpack which I do not need to check in but apparently Warsaw airport has its own rules. Both legs were delayed: over an hour from WAW to VIE and about 45 minutes from VIE to LHR. Star Alliance Business Lounge in Warsaw was overcrowded and had to struggle to find a seat. Onboard the crew was quite polite, though snacks less than modest. Austrian Lounge at Vienna airport looked like a cafe. Not to compare with lounges at Heathrow, Munich or Zurich airports.

I tried to get a seat in the first row and read the magazines provided by the airline, eat the fantastic DO&CO catered lunch and enjoyed myself. The price of 900 Euros for the roundtrip was a bit steep, but the experience was always pleasant. This year no more. I bought a ticket for the same route, same 900 Euros but the trip was terrible. In the lounge were no magazines offered. The flight Vienna to Nice had an Austrian flight number but crew and plane were from Air Berlin.

Austrian Airlines,6,Stepan Hrobar,28th June 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | New York JFK to Vienna. Originally, a smaller Boeing 767 was scheduled, that was also one of the reason we booked this flight. But unfortunately the flight was rescheduled to a triple-seven, with 3-4-3 abreast seating, which is hated by the passengers. So we pre-booked our seats in advance (for a surcharge), to get one of the few seats in the rear of the cabin where the fuselage is narrowing and only 2 instead of 3 seats in the window-rows are used. Definitely worth the 50Ã¢â€šÂ¬ we paid! The flight left with a small delay, but landed on time. Lufthansa's JFK ground staff were not polite, fast or effective. But the cabin crew were OK. The seating on narrow seats was fine for a 8 hour flight, but I can't imagine myself being squeezed there for a few more hours. The cabin crew were fine, but keeping a distance from the passengers and being not as nice as those on the previous Lufthansa flight. The food was mediocre and portions very small - we had booked a vegetarian meal, and for the breakfast, it meant only a few pieces of fresh fruit, whereas other passengers had a giant cereal muffin. Apart from the obvious cost-savings by not using a tray and only handing out one piece of food, the fruit box was very small and definitely not enough for breakfast. Thankfully, one of the cabin attendants gave us spare muffins too, upon our request. Thanks for that! So overall, an OK experience, but there are much better Y-class long haul products out there.",Boeing 777-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,JFK to VIE,Apr-17,3,3,2,5,2,4,yes

The onboard service may be nothing too special, but you'll still get a warm snack and complimentary drinks. For two hour flights that's sufficient. As we were travelling as a family we also got crayons, coloring books and some playing cards for our daughter. The crew was very attentive and proactive. When our daughter feel asleep they brought a pillow without being asked. On the way to Zakynthos the flight departed and arrived on time.

Austrian Airlines,4,K Tueller,21st January 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Shanghai to Lyon via Vienna. This flight went way worse than I expected. I flew from LYS to PVG with SWISS and from PVG to LYS with Austrian Airlines, so I had the possiblity to make the direct comparison between these two Star Alliance members. The flight took about 11.5 hours. During this time the crew served us bewerage just before and during the two meals. If you expect they would come around from time to time to ask the passengers if they'd like to have a glass of water - you were wrong. After some hours I had to go by myself on the back of the plane to ask them for some drinks and a little snack (since the meal itself wasn't even that big, not even for an economy class meal). Besides the fact that the flight attendant didn't even care about us and not even bothered to smile, two of four toilets were not working. After mealtime many people had of course the need to go to the restroom - with a waiting time of sometimes over 15 mins. I guess that's why they didn't serve as much drink as they maybe usually do? What disturbed me most is that the crew or the maitre the cabine didn't greet the passengers at the beginning of the flight or informed us about the failure of the toilets. Just the captain mentioned it 1 hour before landing, and thanked us for our understanding. The overall experience of Austrian is cheap service with lousy flight attendants and bad maintenanced aircrafts.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,PVG to LYS via VIE,Jan-17,3,1,2,4,2,1,no
Austrian Airlines,3,D Mutakin,26th December 2016,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Vienna to Moscow. I see Austrian has no free baggage allowance. That is fine for me since I flew back from my weekend in Vienna with my backpack. I did not expect my backpack will be between my legs during the flight. All the people flying tried to bring everything to the cabin, so all the racks got full pretty quickly with bags that mostly would not qualify as cabin luggage due to their dimensions. Austrian staff at the registration / boarding gate did not seem to care. As a result, the flight attendants said that ""people simply have too much with them"", and all the cabin baggage not properly stowed will be off-loaded into the checked bagage. It took them an hour to sort this all out. I agree the airline managed to beat even Aeroflot on the price but that does not justify their lack of common sence. There is one simple process to avoid all this frustration: just put someone at the gate to measure the dimensions of the cabin baggage! And make the passengers hand all those bags that do not qualify. The meal was just awful, too.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,VIE to DME,Dec-16,1,2,2,,3,3,no

The seats were okay for short-medium flight durations. However, I did not appreciate the fact that we were offered only a small salty or sweet snack and a drink for the 2hr journey. This was at all not sufficient or acceptable for a full cost airline. Overall, I recommend this airline, but do bring extra snack with you.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,ATH to VIE,Nov-16,4,5,2,,5,4,yes
Austrian Airlines,5,Jacob Atkins,23rd November 2016,"Bangkok to Tel Aviv via Vienna with Austrian Airlines. This is a pretty average airline compared to other European airlines I have flown with: Lufthansa, Air France, Swiss. The cabin crew were generally unsmiling and disinterested, although they did work hard to get the first meal served quickly so passengers could sleep. Leg room is on the narrow side, although the seat itself is comfortable. IFE was okay. The food was a let down. Portions were small and the fish, which is usually a healthy option, was just deep fried portions with rice and a small amount of sauce. There was just a sandwich for breakfast, which seems ungenerous on an 11+ hour flight. On the upside we also flew the 777 to TLV and the service on that flight was excellent. Avoid row 18 window seats on the 777 because it's mainly just wall and the window is behind your head.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,BKK to TLV via VIE,Nov-16,3,2,2,3,3,4,no

Austrian Airlines,8,Kah Kay Au,30th September 2016,"I flew from Vienna to Sarajevo with Austrian Airlines. The flight was on an A320. As we boarded, we were greeted by smiling flight attendants dressed in bright red uniform and strains of Mozart's music were being piped through the cabin during boarding. As it was a lunch time flight, I pre-ordered a hot meal of paprika chicken from the airline's contract caterer Do&Co for 15 euros. After levelling off, flight attendants started serving snacks and beverages. My lunch was served piping hot shortly.

Austrian Airlines,8,Stepan Hrobar,29th September 2016,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | We've been rebooked to an Austrian flight due to a previous flight cancellation and we were happy to enjoy a pleasant experience with Austrian flying from Amsterdam to Vienna. Everything went smoothly, flight departed and landed on time, cabin crew were helpful (could have smiled a bit more though). There was only a little chocolate snack and drink service, but for the short flight it was ok (although KLM served a wrap on the same route). The A319 felt very spacious and clean, it's been refitted with new slim seats which are very comfortable, definitely enough for short haul flights, thanks to slim seats, the legroom is also quite decent. I like the A320 series more than B737, as they are much quieter in my opinion. Looking forward to trying Austrian's long haul service next year, by now, I'd definitely reccomend Austrian Airlines.",A319,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,AMS to VIE,Sep-16,4,4,3,,4,4,yes

Business class lie flat seat with HD large screen personal entertainment device. The entertainment selection was limited, actually watched a Japanese film with translation.

Also on Austrian, you get one meal (not bad quality) and then a sandwich with a yoghurt for the second meal just before landing at Bangkok.

Checked in luggage and proceeded to Sky Lounge priority pass. Flight was delayed for a hour. The seat I was allocated at the airport was exit aisle. Empty seat next to me which was great.

This on its own would be frustrating yet bearable, the true problems arrived in how both myself and many others were forced to wait for three hours before being even able to talk with airline staff.

Beyond being forced to wait for an absurd amount of time, the compensation offered was negligible, despite how due to the delays we were arriving ten hours later.

Having tried to get an upgrade I was told business is full and they are evening downgrading people. Had to press the call button a number of times to get someone to bring some water. When someone finally came, I asked why I had to press the button ten times, she said 'sir we are experiencing turbulence' eventhough we really were not and the seat belt sign was off.

Austrian Airlines,8,Andrew Chiu,18th June 2016,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Toronto to Bucharest via Vienna. The flight of Austrian Airlines for me and my wife from Toronto (Canada) to Bucharest (Romania), via Vienna, (Austria) was not what I had expected in terms of scheduling and mechanical problems, that led to a half-day delay and missing our my arranged pick-up from the airport to our hotel. However, the ground staff at Vienna was extremely helpful and courteous. We were offered a small lunch voucher to compensate for the delay. When I complained to Austrian Airlines after our trip to Eastern Europe, the customer service staff responded promptly. We were compensated for an amount of Canadian $100, which was much more than what I claimed for our loss. We appreciate the generosity of Austrian Airlines and the customer respect we received from this Airline. It appears that delay in flights is not unusual with Austrian Airlines. This may be an area that needs some improvement. However, the ground staff and on-board services were excellent and the food and drinks are good. The seats and on-board entertainment may need some attention.

British Airways,7,C Down,20th October 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Faro to Gatwick. Check in was quiet at the club Europe desk and I was very quickly booked in. Fast track security at the airport wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t particularly well managed, although I did get through quicker than I would have otherwise. Disappointingly British Airways do not provide any lounge access at Faro, and there is currently a lot of construction taking place in the main departure lounge, and the builders are not exactly considerate with the noise! There was no priority queue at the entrance to the gate and as usual British Airways did a fairly half hearted job at ensuring priority boarding of the aircraft itself. The aircraft was the new style, which I think is very smart and nicely decorated (not budget airline as some commentators like to say), and whilst the legroom isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t amazing I am 6Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ tall and was quite comfortable and having the extra table space makes it a more usable space. The cabin crew were very friendly and professional whilst also being very efficient. A bar service with nuts was delivered soon after take off along with the menu for the flight. All of the cold parts of the meal and the drinks were excellent, sadly the chicken main was quite overcooked leading to dry chicken and soggy veg. That being said it tasted very nice. Arriving into Gatwick was a dream, especially for a large airport. Although the buildings are quite old and not laid out as well as newer ones, they have done a fantastic job at modernising it and making security very quick. It took a little while for bags to reach the belt but priority bags all came out first so the process was fairly painless. I got a good deal on the flight so I would say it was reasonably good value for money, although the experience in Faro airport does reduce the premium feel considerably.",A320,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Faro to Gatwick,Oct-17,4,5,4,,2,3,yes
British Airways,2,Stephen Sales,20th October 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Los Angeles to London Heathrow. The inflight entertainment was not working so no tv, video, music or radio. USB socket not working. Headphones not working. Customer service very poor. Cabin crew seemed to be unaware that they were carrying paying passengers upon whom their jobs depend. Food mediocre. There was no apple juice or tomato juice on the dinner trolley and the cabin crew didn't bother to fetch any. Tea served with breakfast was luke warm and stewed. No refreshments supplied unless collected from the galley It took 2 days to get through to customer relations, many calls cutting off after 18 minutes +, others cancelled after going through options. I cannot recommend British Airways who in my case certainly did not fly to serve. The experience was far below expectations and definitely at the lower budget range for customer service.

British Airways,3,M Seward,19th October 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | London Heathrow to Bangkok. Was looking forward to eventually flying with British Airways after flying reguarly to Bangkok with other airlines - how disappointed I was. A low budget product with a premium price. I will never again use this airline, its the most costly option (usually) for my regular journey to Thailand, but it ranks the lowest of all the airlines I've used on this route in past 30 trips. Seatback screen so small and of poor quality, service is dreadful, seats are old with no powerpoints, no wifi on board. Best part of the trip was getting off. Absolutely shameful for a national carrier of the UK. Lower your costs BA as you really are budget - go fly with any of the Gulf airlines or a vast majority of Europe's best, BA are nowhere near good enough. Current price almost a 3rd more than the other 2 direct flights (EVA and Thai) to Bangkok and British Airways is only half as good as those.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Bangkok,Oct-17,2,2,1,1,2,2,no

Check-in at Malaga was a breeze although security was packed even though a quiet Sunday. VIP lounge at Malaga used by BA and other airlines (apparently its the only one there) is pretty useless compared with the old BA lounge that used to be there - cost cutting ?? Guess we were spoiled by Gatwick !! Drink okay but limited, food pretty awful but seating comfortable and it is very spacious. Flight left on time and again arrived half an hour early due I guess to help from Hurricane Ophelia which I guess we were on the fringe of. In board catering and drinks up to the usual quality and very pleasant crew - chatted to the First Officer, nice man.

British Airways,10,S Porter,18th October 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Gatwick to Malaga. First flight with BA from new home at South Terminal at London Gatwick. Upon arrival at check-in at 6:30 a.m was a bit disappointed to see few staff available to deal with Business class passengers resulting in a 20 minute wait to sort out our bags. However, Fast Track through Customs was efficient and made up for the earlier minor irritation. New lounge in South Terminal is spacious and food and beverages up to the usual good quality, although sadly, the reduction towards a cheap airline is showing in the cracks. A319 to Malaga was uneventful and onboard food was well presented and of good quality. We arrived 30 mins ahead of schedule due to fortunate winds so cannot complain.

British Airways,2,K Lanson,17th October 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | London to Abu Dhabi. I told BA at check-in that I would be interested in upgrading to Premium Economy if a window seat was available. The lady replied ""can I check - you are only interested in upgrading if there is a window"". I replied yes. After a series of phone calls, the upgrade was processed (I paid 149 GBP). My seat had no window or view at all as that seat is situated at the back of Premium Economy where the toilets should be. When I complained, I was told that seats could not be guaranteed so I had no complaint. No refund offered, no token gesture offered, nothing. The food was nice and the seat was very comfortable. If it wasn't for the rude customer service I would fly again. I was led to believe I could pay for a window seat and I paid in good faith. I've flown BA for years, but this year has been disappointing. I won't fly with them again.",,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,London to Abu Dhabi,Aug-17,5,3,4,3,1,1,no
British Airways,4,S Laiken,11th October 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Grand Cayman to London. I can't comprehend is why a flight that sums up to about 12 hours of travel across the Atlantic Ocean, only allows 1 check in free bag for economy class. Upon returning to GCM from LON on October 6, 2017, I had to pay Ã‚Â£290 for additional baggage. Particularly for university students (such as myself) who migrate from such distances to achieve good education. In addition to the disgusting rates for additional baggage, has BA gotten so cheap that they no longer provide a complimentary travel toothbrush, toothpaste & eye mask for 12 hour flights? That was one of the things I appreciated most about BA as it made me feel valued. I am truly disappointed with BA these days and whenever the day comes that another airline travels directly to LON from GCM you guarantee I WILL abandon BA!",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Grand Cayman to London,Sep-17,1,2,2,3,3,2,no

I assume for long distance flight airlines should provide you a mask for you to sleep, ear plugs, maybe a small tube of toothpaste. Here you have some headphones and that's all.

The staff that looked after us flying out to Florida and home were outstanding, on the way home the seating had been already arranged and my seat was separate from my two children, I was really worried about flying home away from my children, I spoke to the flight supervisor who kindly asked two passengers if they would switch seats which they were happy to do. The seats were very good and went back enough so you were able to get to sleep, the only thing we werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t to happy with was the movies but I guess you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have everything.

British Airways,6,I Dorlan,7th October 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Los Angeles to Doha via London. Great staff, poor food and stupid cabin layout. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m spoilt flying gulf airlines, but this time I tried a rear facing Ã¢â‚¬Å“internalÃ¢â‚¬Â 4 of 345 configuration. Firstly, staring in the face of my two new best friends (seats facing forward) was at best weird, and at worst like a business class speed dating experience. Crew could barely serve me, ventilation was restricted and access 100% blocked by the foot rests of forward facing passengers. Once the security screens went up I felt like I was in some sort of flying crypt and was tempted to assume brace position to give the impression I had died and was on a viewing. The food was embarrassing bad - bigger serves of economy style food in bigger economy style bowls.

British Airways,7,Mike Palmer,1st October 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Toronto to London in Premium Economy and onto Oslo in Economy. Easy check in and in the lounge within 15 mins. The usual selection of dry sandwiches, and a chicken noodle soup (minus the chicken and noodle). The lounge was clean with plenty of staff clearing away. Efficient boarding with sparking wine/soft drinks offered. Early departure, fast drink service and dinner before lights out. There was no breakfast (previously scrapped) with the cereal bar now also gone. Early arrival, a short wait for a shower in the North Lounge, followed by an ok breakfast. An early departure and an average flight on a A319. Long queues for the bathroom (only one now for all of economy as the other was removed to provide 2 more seats) with slow buy on board service though at least they made it to the last row mainly down to little take up of food or drink. Early arrival though a long wait for bags. Oslo to London on a A320 was verging on a farce, A full flight, selfish use of the overheads delayed departure whilst crew looked for space. The buy onboard came out quickly with one and then the second handheld machine dying at the first row served. Service ground to a halt whilst the crew tried to get either machine back into life, broke out the paper visa slips, took the cart back in, re-appeared 20 mins later so service started an hour into the flight. Little take up as people had given up including me as there was little time left to enjoy the purchases. The crew tried really hard, put a brave face on and kept going. The organisation and concept of the BA buy on board is a disgrace. Though a third party provides the food and card machines, the choice, stock holding and the reliability of payment machines means the service is a farce. I don't understand why BA continue to struggle with this service as Easyjet, Ryanair and low cost carriers seem to have have to cracked it and got their act together. Early arrival and fast bags completed the flight. Final flight home to Toronto was good, the club lounge at the B gates remains quiet, clean and an oasis to relax and eat/drink before flying. The 787 was towed to the gate 45 mins before departure and was never going to leave on time. At the gate, the experience was enhanced with an upgrade to business class. Service was really slow on boarding I had to ask for champagne, and the underwhelming bag of toiletries and shades only offered after take off. We pushed back over 30 late. No signs of life from crew for another 30 mins, though a positive enhancement was tray service for drinks which felt more classy than a cart. The main of steak was excellent and looked to be on new crockery and plated after cooking (no dried gravy or potato around the edges). Afternoon tea remains underwhelming with no scones and only three sandwiches still wrapped in plastic. Overall, the decline in service seems to have stopped with some minor improvements. The crew on all four flights were pleasant but lacking confidence and experience. The desire to do things by the book results in slow and wooden service at times. Other than the farce of buy on board, I was pleased there appeared to be no further decline in service.",Boeing 777-200 / 787-9 / A319/ 320,Business,Premium Economy,Toronto to Oslo via London,Sep-17,1,3,1,3,4,4,yes
British Airways,6,Alistair Wharton,29th September 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | A return British Airways flight from London to Sofia was a service of 2 halves. The outboard leg was very good from London to Bulgaria, the check in was swift and efficient, boarding the flight was simple and quick. The 2 bag on the flight policy was enforced and stowing bags on the plane was quick. Disembarking off the plane was straight forward and easy. The flight was worth a good 8 out of 10. The return flight from Sofia to London was the opposite. Check in was slow and not inefficient. There was no priority boarding of the plane and it was a Ryanair type of scramble to board the plane. The 2 bag on the flight policy was not enforced so many people got on the flight with a roller bag, a rucksack and then a small holdall! The 5 cabin crew had a nightmare experience trying to stow all the bags before take off. Once airborne the M&S service was sold out before halve of the economy cabin was served. With only drinks and crisps available towards the end. Finally disembarking the plane was a slow and drawn out affair as passengers where trying to locate their 3 bags while holding up the isle. Overall I would give this leg 4 out of 10.",A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Sofia,Sep-17,3,5,2,,3,3,yes
British Airways,3,Paul Taylor,27th September 2017,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | London Heathrow to New York. After reading reviews I was hoping some were inaccurate, but after this flight in Club World I realise that BA has fallen even lower than many have said. Check in at T5 was interminably slow with one of the most arrogant staff I have encountered for years. The lounge was crowded and dirty, and the food selection is terrible for a premium facility. Onboard, seats are old and tatty, cramped and uncomfortable and offer no privacy whatsoever. The food was passed across my neighbours seat to reach me, and what a lousy offering this was - below many airline economy meal standards. IFE screen was not working properly, fuzzy and very poor. Cabin crew were polite and trying to be friendly, but they certainly hide in the galley as soon as they can and judging from the standard of the toilets towards the end of the flight, they do not see it as part of their job to maintain these.

I havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t taken a Qantas domestic flight for a few years, so I decided to pay the Ã¢â‚¬Å“premiumÃ¢â‚¬Â cost of a Qantas ticket compared to some low cost carriers. For what is essentially double the cost of other carriers, I got a flight with no IFE screens, a lunch of a pre Packaged quiche that was unedible after one bite and a final surprise when we landed of a suitcase with a wheel missing. The suitcase is a decent quality brand that is less then a year old and in that year is has been on some budget carriers (such as Air Asia) and survived without a scratch. I can only imagine how the well the Qantas baggage handlers must have handled it to case a wheel (including it bracket) to go missing Next time I need to fly domestic, I will be flying a budget carrier, where IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m happy to pay an additional cost for food which is actually edible, and with the money I save I can buy a new suitcase.

Qantas Airways,3,Loke Foo,13th March 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | I have three issues with the Airbus 330-200 business class fight of Qantas from Singapore to Sydney. Seat - the new business class seat is very narrow and small, especially the footrest area after the bed has been extended to lay flat mode. I was not able to sleep on my side because my feet were not able to fit the footrest area. All the panels in the new seat are supposed to provide privacy for the passenger but they do also have the unintended effect of making the seats feel much smaller. Lack of toilet - There is only one toilet for the whole business class. There are 28 seats in business class and the business class passengers to toilet ratio must be the worst among all the premier full-service airlines. In the morning after breakfast was served and before the touch down at Sydney, the queue for the toilet was so bad that I did not even get a chance to go before we arrived in Sydney. Those 330-200 with the older version of business class seats have 2 toilets in Business class. I am wondering if Qantas chose to reduce the toilet number in order to fit in more seats. Coffee - The coffee that Qantas serves for breakfast is the worst that I have tasted for a long time. It was too diluted. After milk was added, the colour of the coffee was whitish brown. The coffee was definitely instant coffee. Qantas should invest in a better-brewed coffee machine for business class passengers. Hope that Qantas can look into the above three issues. Services have also improved a lot in the last few years and there is still room for improvement.",A330-200,Business,Business Class,Singapore to Sydney,Mar-19,1,3,1,3,2,2,no
Qantas Airways,1,H Meares,7th March 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Brisbane to Melbourne. I always like to be positive. My rule is Ã¢â‚¬Å“If you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t say anything nice donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t say anything at allÃ¢â‚¬Â. However today I feel I need to make an exception to the rule in light of my recent experience with Qantas. On Thursday 21st Feb I flew to Brisbane with my husband for a conference. On Sunday evening 25th Feb as we were on our way to the airport for our return flight I had a serious fall down 15 steps. I was rushed by ambulance to the Mater hospital where I spent the night being treated for broken bones, lacerations, sprains and multiple bruising. On discharge the Hospital gave me a letter for Qantas confirming that I was unable to make my flight due to a Medical Emergency. After several days of to and fro messages with the Qantas Bot asking for a refund for my missed flight (to cover the cost of eventually taking another flight home to Melbourne), I am horrified to be told that I am not eligible for a refund as I was a No Show. Qantas was advised well before the departure time that I had had an accident and was in hospital. The irony is that had I attempted to take the flight Qantas would not have allowed me on the flight in the condition I was in. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve always respected Qantas as a reputable Australian airline with the good old Aussie Spirit of caring for its customers. No more! I now believe that Qantas is just another heartless profiteering company who cares nothing for its passengers, has no morality or business ethics and belies the appearance of a humanitarian spirit.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Brisbane to Melbourne,Feb-19,2,2,1,,1,1,no

Cabin crew friendly, polite and efficient. Inflight entertainment good. The seats were comfortable for such a long flight. Food was above average for an airline.

Qantas Airways,2,B Vassani,25th February 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | I had the opportunity to travel with Quantas for the first time on my journey from London to Singapore (roundtrip) and I will never travel with this airline again. The staff was nice, seats average, where they lost the most amount of points for me was in relation to food and inflight entertainment. Usually on all of the long hall flights I travel on they offer such a range of amazing movies in different languages and varieties, but on Qantas they merely offered a few movies and out dated 'horror ones' there were no tv shows nor any documentaries it was all very lackluster. My biggest area of disappointment regards food, especially since I had requested a vegetarian meal. Now I am not a picky eater, but the meals offered were so disgusting that I was only able to take a few bites. When the meal arrives it is the main dish only on a trey with a piece of bread and desert in the bag thus taking away from the whole cute inflight meal aesthetic. It was very difficult for me to figure out what it was that I was going to eat as the food items did not look anything like food, I had to read the label in order to understand what is being offered. I did try the meals and could only stomach 2 bites each. I really wonder if the chef had tried what he had made, because it is a great disservice to the customer. This chef either needs to be retrained or fired, if he/she will go into retraining they should collaborate with those from Emirates, Korean, etc. Furthermore, the vegetables were so over cooked that any nutrients that should have been available ceased to exist.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Singapore,Feb-19,2,5,1,1,1,2,no
Qantas Airways,8,Johnathan Yeo,19th February 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Singapore to Auckland via Brisbane. Got window seats on both the flights, which were on the same plane. Glad to have the seat next to me free, so nothing against legroom. Cabin crew had friendly and cordial service, with smiles present. Had a sizeable supper on the first flight even though I was informed there'd be breakfast, was pleasantly surprised. Beef paired with Bloody Mary was well eaten. Breakfast was muffin and fruit with coffee. Decent to good. Second flight had another breakfast, frittata with bacon and sausage and coffee, was good. Again, with an empty seat and cheerful cabin crew who helped me with my arrival cards as well. IFE was a bit lacking but decent selections.

Qantas Airways,6,Murray Jones,17th February 2019,"Not Verified | Los Angeles to Sydney. Was looking forward to trying out Qantas International again after 15+ years of choosing other airlines due to poor quality and service on my last flight. This time it was a mixed experience. The A380 is a fantastic aircraft and I've been on the Singapore Airlines, Qatar, Malaysian and Emirates versions previously. Unfortunately the Qantas version had seen better times. This plane was old and although the seating was new, you could tell the rest of it had taken a beating including the carpets, toilets and galley. The flight attendants on this plane (although very polite) verged on the wrong side of professional vs casual friendliness and as we were seated next to the galley, we overheard way too much much casual gossip and cattyness which I felt was not doing the airline reputation much good. Our attendant even commented that he was 'exhausted' before the flight even took off. What was good : the food was pretty decent for economy, as were the free flowing tim-tams and bundaberg ginger beer available from the fridges at the back of the plane - well done, a nice touch and keep it up. Would I choose Qantas again? Probably not. The competition (particularly Singapore Airlines) has a better, more professional product. More needs to be done to bring Qantas up to this level. I'd start with updating the plane and staff conduct.",A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Sydney,Feb-19,2,3,4,3,3,3,no
Qantas Airways,10,M Ivancic,14th February 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Perth to Adelaide, a fantastic experience. I was traveling with an elderly passenger and initially we were not seated together. I asked a ground staff member if they could change the seating arrangements. It was not a problem and the staff member at Perth airport rearranged the seating, and did this with a smile. The aircraft was comfortable and clean, cabin crew friendly and service without a flaw. We had a choice of three meals, plus cheese and crackers, and beverages included soft drinks and alcholoic drinks. Fifteen minutes or so after lunch was served the cabin crew came around offering tea and coffee. I recommend Qantas and they offer an excellent domestic product.",Boeing 737,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Perth to Adelaide,Feb-19,5,5,5,5,5,5,yes
Qantas Airways,9,Alan Thompson,13th February 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Sydney to London via Singapore. A really good experience. Qantas lounge and boarding not the best but upstairs on the A380 is a comfortable calm experience. Lovely cabin crew on first leg (I slept much of the second so didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t notice so much), a really good Neil Perry dinner, one of the best dishes of Barramundi IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve eaten. A treat to be made an Espresso afterwards. Though the window seat requires crossing the next seat to get to the aisle it is a very comfortable seat to relax and sleep and the massage function is a bonus. Slept much of the second flight using provided pyjamas. Woke to an excellent. freshly cooked scrambled egg and smoked salmon breakfast.

The meal served was very tasty and it was nice to have a glass of beer. My only complaint was the IFE. It is such a shame that we no longer have access to music on domestic flights. It makes a flight so much more enjoyable.

Friendly cabin crew, clean aircraft, good inflight entertainment and outstanding service. This is an Australian domestic flight and Australians when flying domestic. Lunch included two choices of hot meal, alcoholic beverages or soft drinks and tea or coffee. Having cut my finger during the flight, a flight attendant was most helpful, providing first aid. After the cabin manager came to personally see me to check everything was ok. The crew could not do enough to assist with this matter.

Qantas Airways,4,B Hay,4th February 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Bangkok to Sydney. Having just flown with Cathay, Finnair and Qatar business class all previously in the past 3 weeks it was an excellent opportunity to compare Qantas and where it sits as a quality air service provider. Sadly it rated a long distant last. It started with the Brisbane Business lounge at the international terminal where the food was scant and not worth eating. The staff were pleasant but the best bubbles they could serve was about a $12 Australian sparkling wine that really very ordinary. Every other carrier offered French champagne in their service offering - but not Qantas. Boarding the plane in Bangkok, the crew looked confused and tired and overall the service was minimal on-route to Sydney. The champagne served onboard was one of the cheapest available and the food was very ordinary. I had the salad as a starter and then the green curry vegetables and noodles. The green curry sauce has split and curdled and was very ordinary. The fresh fruit was nice. Breakfast was a bacon and egg ciabatta sandwich - they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t serve hot breakfasts any more on Qantas flights! The entertainment was good, although the headphones are the poorest quality out of all the flights and my first set were faulty. The toilets were the same size as economy - small! Whereas the other airlines had much roomier bathrooms. The bathroom had paper towels whereas the others had cloth. There were no creams or amenities in the bathroom whilst the others all did. The plane was looking tired. The travel pjÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s were a nice touch and comfortable. Overall Qantas is not rewarding its business class travellers with service and product offerings for which they are charging a premium price. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s simply not worth the money. They appear to have cut too many corners to squeeze every cent of savings from the budget, but they forget the client is paying substantial money for the privilege of flying with them and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s simply not worth it. Qatar Airways was a standout and are simply exceptional in every aspect, Finnair were also excellent, and Cathay is a little tired but still streets in front of Qantas.",,Business,Business Class,Bangkok to Sydney,Jan-19,4,3,2,4,2,2,no
Qantas Airways,7,P Huang,4th February 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Wellington to Brisbane Via Sydney. The return journey was measurably better then my departure for Wellington 3 days prior. Check-In and security was very quick considering how early it was, though Wellington airport is another story. Departure was on time with an early arrival. Inflight Service was efficient, but it was an early morning flight with most passengers catching up on sleep or having breakfast while keeping to themselves. Cabin Crew were friendly and polite, I did notice a lot of conversation between them and It should be minimise as they are working. IFE was limited, only a handful of movie/tv shows are good to watch.

Qantas Airways,1,David Brennan,30th January 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Sydney to Bangkok. The flight in both directions was made terrible by the crew, who were the rudest I've come across. They hid in the galley for most of the flight, rudely brushed aside requests for service, and mechanically handed out one plate of food and one drink for the evening meal, then a cardboard box as an excuse for 'breakfast' (see photo) just before landing. Check in was via a machine, so can't really comment on how bad the ground staff might have been.

Flying back home, I had Seat 1D, which was an aisle seat which meant I could get up anytime without disrupting the passenger next to me. I like the red plus leather seats, nothing overly special but does the job for short haul trips like mine. We departed on time without a hitch. The plane's wifi was fully functional the entire flight. I thought the service was fantastic, topping up my wine before it was even finished and without asking.

Qantas Airways,7,L Pearce,28th January 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Brisbane to Wellington Via Sydney. The trip started off smooth, easy check-in process with fast security and on time departure from Brisbane to Sydney. Team onboard were great too followed by decent catering and IFE. However, from Sydney to Wellington thing went slightly downhill. The trip was over an hour delayed due to late incoming aircraft so by the time I reached Wellington and go through the airport procedures, it was 2am by the time I actually went to sleep. What I find most disappointing, is the fact that they made the delayed announcements when it was time to actually board for the original time of departure. It's very simple to keep communication transparent. Service and IFE onboard was decent during the second flight, though it was too late at night to actually appreciate it.",Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Brisbane to Wellington via Sydney,Jan-19,3,3,3,3,3,4,yes

I was surprise, I was pregnant and they were just squeeze me in tight corner when i wanted to go to the lavatory. Second time, my flight from Sydney to NZ. Its even worse the airplane small, seat very uncomfortable and they broke one of my suitcase (the wheels and upper handle) and i went to the baggage service counter. They didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do anything unless i go to their repair store which is out of the airport.

Qantas Airways,1,M Saunders,22nd January 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | I was very disappointed with the flight from Sydney to Perth for the following reasons. This flight had no entertainment whatsoever, only a drop down small screen about 3 rows in front which showed a feature on racing cars which I had no interest at all. My husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seat was faulty, the Steward came along the tried to fix it but no luck and as the plane was completely full he just had to put up with it. The air hostesses did come along and offered champagne to both of us and also a bottle of red wine. There were only two toilets down the back of the plane for Economy and one up the front for Business which meant that there was a line half way down the plane with passengers waiting to use the toilet.

On the longer flights, Qantas offered a menu with three choices of meals plus choice of wine, beer etc. There were pillows, blankets, headsets, ear plugs, tooth brushes and so on offered to all passengers. The airplanes were spotless, modern, full entertainment package, great monitors with flexible positioning for optimum viewing, and so on.

Qantas Airways,2,L Deane,15th January 2019,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trip Verified | Sydney to Milan via Dubai. I have been terribly disappointed in QANTAS as on two occasions when I have needed to speak with a customer services member urgently and I have not been able to call them. The line is even worse than centrelink because the call hangs up on you after 20 minutes. Today I have tried calling them on the 131313 number 4 times with no joy, after we urgently need to rebook a ticket as my boyfriend is stranded in Australia. This was also the case when I wanted to check on special baggage. I cannot express just how frustrating this experience has been and I am appalled at the poor treatment of customers in pretending that it is possible to contact QANTAS when in fact it is near impossible. if your flight goes well no worries the aircrew staff are always friendly, because they are real genuine people, but in this case when something goes really wrong or if you need to check something with them it is a nightmare due to the fact they have severely cut customer communication channels to what seems to be an extreme degree.=",A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Milan via Dubai,Jan-19,3,5,5,5,5,1,no
flydubai,10,S Nitali,6th November 2016,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Beirut to Dubai. I am reviewing this carrier comparing it with similar i.e. low cost airline.

Large individual screen with a decent selection of entertainment. For lunch I was served dory fish as main course and the lunch was tasty.

flydubai,1,S Beher,23rd October 2016,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | Bishkek to Bahrain via Dubai. The epitome of a low cost carrier lies firmly with Fly Dubai. I flew the carrier from Bishkek to Bahrain via Dubai. With a six hour layover, one would think there is sufficient time for baggage to make the connection. But upon arrival in Bahrain, my baggage is missing in action. Upon filing a missing baggage report, I am advised that Fly Dubai does not provide a per diem allowance to cover essentials while baggage is tracked. Later I am advised that there is another Fly Dubai flight in another three hours and it may be on that flight. But, no, that is still not sufficient time for the airline to resolve the issue. Finally, it arrives via Gulf Air (Thank you for stepping up to the plate where Fly Dubai fails dramatically). Only to be told I should return to the airport to collect it myself as Fly Dubai, as a low budget carrier service does not offer such service. Really. Maybe you should check my passenger record that I am incapacitated due to two surgeries on my foot and require a wheel chair. Great service you offer. Low budget - ticket prices was similar to that of full service airline, Turkish Airlines, but flydubai presented the shortest time (or so I thought) between point to point. Maybe flydubai CEO does not realize the level of service that is being provided and never studied marketing that the cost of losing one customer is equivalent of capturing ten new customers.

flydubai,1,Mohammed Midhath,19th August 2016,"Ã¢Å“â€¦ Verified Review | The worst ever flight experience. It is a budget airline, but its not cheap either. My return flight from Doha to Dubai was scheduled to depart at 18.05. First they announced that there is a 30 minutes delay, this was after standing the boarding queue for 20 mins. Until 18.45, there was no announcement or nothing from them. They started boarding again by 18.50, and send some people in the flight. They stopped the boarding once more and said no more people will be taken inside the flight. They gave weird reasons saying the air pressure in the flight is too high, so they will not take anymore people. And asked the rest of us to take the flight which departs at 20.20. So there was a 2.15 hours delay in the airport. The worst is yet to come as the AC was not working in the flight they made us sit after 2.15 hours of delay.

flydubai,6,Abdullah Al-Rubaiah,29th January 2016,"Kuwait to Dubai with FlyDubai. This airline is considered low cost but their prices can be more expensive than Emirates. The base fare is cheap but you have to pay for the baggage, seats, food and inflight entertainment system. If you don't want to pay for the baggage you can take 7kg for the carry on baggage, if you want to check baggage this will cost you more. When selecting seats I chose the first row which costs $26USD per person ($260USD total) - it is cheaper at the rear of the aircraft. Flight was on a Boeing 737-800 - the seats were dirty and not really comfortable. The windows were very dirty. The cabin crew service is poor and rude. The should really limit the pieces of carry on baggage because from Kuwait to Dubai the airplane was delayed due to an huge amount of baggage that won't fit in the lockers. In the end, the amount I paid for economy class was the same amount I would pay for business class. I would recommend Emirates over FlyDubai - prices are better and their aircraft are cleaner.",Boeing 737-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,KWI to DXB,Jan-16,2,1,1,5,2,2,no
flydubai,1,Peter Wainberg,4th January 2016,"Avoid if possible. flydubai cancelled my Dubai to Khartoum flight without any explanation or apology a couple of days before Christmas, resulting in an 18 hour layover. I requested that they at least pay for a hotel room. The only way to contact them is via an email, but they did not respond, and did not offer to compensate me for the hotel room. I based the start of my trip around the timing of the cancelled flight. They obviously feel as if they have a monopoly, and just don't care.",,Business,Economy Class,DXB to KRT,Jan-16,1,1,1,,1,1,no
flydubai,2,N Dias,4th January 2016,flydubai from Tehran to Dubai. Very disappointed. Flight was 4+ hours late and staff gave us no information or assurance. Captain didn't explain reason for delay or offer apology. Rather unprofessional. Staff on board were courteous and helpful and the plane was clean. But will probably avoid travelling again because they don't take their customers seriously.,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,IKA to DXB,Jan-16,3,4,1,3,2,2,no
flydubai,1,L Aghlab,27th December 2015,Dubai to Colombo return. The seats are small compared to other economy cabin seats. No recline and leg room. Both flights delayed. Terminal 2 lacks basic facilities and below average. - Limited overpriced snacks and meals onboard for purchase. -IFE kept freezing. (paid additional) I will never fly them again.,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Colombo,Dec-15,1,1,1,1,1,3,no
flydubai,1,Auxiliadora Franca,11th December 2015,"flydubai is a terrible airline. Shabby Boeing 737 from DXB to AMM, no service and staff rude. The lines in Terminal 2 in Dubai are appalling and take forever, some 15 counters, only 5 working during rush hours. I chose them not for the price but I wanted to try something fresh - huge mistake, flight delayed by an hour and still no apologies. I will never fly flydubai again.",Boeing 737,Family Leisure,Economy Class,DXB to AMM,Dec-15,3,1,1,1,1,1,no
flydubai,10,Michel Sakr,3rd December 2015,"Dubai to Beirut with flydubai. I was worried after reading several conflicting experiences about flydubai, however booked on them dues to the affordable price for the business seats and convenience of flight time, having flown this leg I was pleasantly surprised of the positive experience I had. Business class was almost identical to a major airline, from own counter to a lounge, separate boarding bus and very convenient seats. Plane was new, entertainment with latest movies releases, etc. Good blankets. Flight attendants not too caring but it was more than enough for a low cost, and better than low cost airlines attendants who usually try to push lottery tickets and duty free items all flights long. The Captain and first officer were very communicative and informed us several times on flight updates, turbulences etc. Flight was on time for takeoff and landing. All in all a very positive experience from a low cost.",Boeing 737-800,Business,Business Class,DXB to BEY,Dec-15,5,4,5,5,5,5,yes
flydubai,3,Andre Souza,18th November 2015,"Dubai to Doha, and Bahrain to Amman. Horrendous airline, a very rude and mediocre service. They are not as cheap as other airlines on the region but still I decided to try them, a very poor decision, flights often delayed, pay per everything as they are a ""low cost"" airline. The terminal used, Terminal 2 is dirty and lacks the basics. Ground staff don't know how to check visa requirements properly. Before boarding there was one staff aggressively checking documents. Onboard the cabin crew are indifferent and rush the service in order to be free to chat on the galley. I was really disappointed by flydubai and will do my best to avoid them in the future.",Boeing 737,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,DXB to DOH,Oct-15,3,1,1,1,1,1,no
flydubai,3,Fouad Khazen,2nd November 2015,"Tried flydubai from Bahrain to Dubai after a long time. This time their online check in gave me the wrong seat. This has happened to me before with them. Once it does, nobody can sort it out until you go to the airport, which negates the whole point of having an online check in.",A320,Business,Economy Class,BAH to DXB,Nov-15,3,1,2,1,2,2,no
flydubai,2,Robert Neely,23rd September 2015,"My first time with flydubai on 20 Sept will be my last. The tickets are cheap at the start, then flydubai charge you for carry on bags, seat assignment, and in flight entertainment etc. On my flight back from Dubai to Kuwait I had no bags to check in, my flight was due to leave within 45 mins and the check in staff for 30 mins tried to explain to me that I had to purchase another ticket because I was 15 min late. Needless to say I purchased the ticket, and informed them that I was not happy with the service I was provided. My only conclusion is that since flights are not full they make up excuses to make passengers buy additional tickets.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Kuwait,Sep-15,2,3,,,1,1,no
flydubai,8,O Omar,23rd August 2015,"Flew HBE-DXB return. Outbound, in July was during Ramadan, typically a low season for FZ out of Alexandria. Check-in agents at HBE not particularly efficient or polite, but given the low loads (I think this flight must have had like 30 passengers onboard) this was not an issue. The flight itself was uneventful, as most everyone went to sleep and abstained from eating/drinking. Did not see cabin crew perform a drink run, nor was in-flight entertainment started. Flight comfortable as I got to stretch out. Return flight was busier, but with plenty of empty seats. Cabin crew friendly and attentive, and were selling drinks and sandwiches/snacks. FlyDubai operates 3-4 daily roundtrips on the route, so plenty of flights to choose from. Once you're done adding extras (bags, extra legroom seats) ticket price goes up a bit, but you definitely get what you pay for. FZ is my only choice on this route, and much more preferable to Egyptair's own nonstop.",Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,HBE to DXB,Aug-15,4,4,3,3,2,4,yes
flydubai,9,Syed Mustaffa Samsudeen,10th August 2015,I traveled from Dubai to Chennai round-trip. On time departure and arrival. Very nice and new aircraft's with good interior and pleasant to fly.
